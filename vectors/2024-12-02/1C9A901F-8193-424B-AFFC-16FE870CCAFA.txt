Tone: contentious

Summary:
The House of Lords debated the progress and implementation challenges regarding Great British Nuclear's (GBN) deployment plans for small and advanced modular reactors, highlighting ongoing negotiations and evaluation processes ahead of expected decisions in spring.
Cross-party discussions underscored the potential socioeconomic benefits of nuclear developments, notably in regions like north-west Wales, and urged further advancement in domestic production to reduce reliance on Russian nuclear fuel and meet healthcare needs.
Ministerial responses indicated cautious optimism about future policies and international collaboration but acknowledged challenges in administrative processes and the need for enhanced security measures for small modular reactors.

Topics:
Environment and Natural Resources:
  Energy Policy and Renewable Resources

Key Points:
Baroness Bloomfield of Hinton Waldrist (Conservative, Life peer):
    Baroness Bloomfield of Hinton Waldrist inquired about the progress of Great British Nuclear (GBN) in deploying small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced modular reactors (AMRs), and examined the process for evaluating their design and manufacturing.
    
Keywords: Great British Nuclear, small modular reactors, advanced modular reactors, design evaluation, manufacturing process

Lord Hunt of Kings Heath (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Hunt of Kings Heath responded, stating that GBN is progressing with negotiations for SMR deployment, with final decisions expected in the spring. The government is exploring alternative routes for AMRs and will announce its policy stance soon.
    
Keywords: GBN progress, SMR deployment, AMR policy, nuclear negotiations, government exploration

Baroness Bloomfield of Hinton Waldrist (Conservative, Life peer):
    Baroness Bloomfield questioned the delay in GBN's schedule, speculating staff shortages, underfunding, approval layers, or underestimated workload as possible causes.
    Context: Original inquiry about GBN's delays
Keywords: GBN schedule, staff shortages, underfunding, workload, Whitehall approval

Lord Hunt of Kings Heath (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Hunt defended GBN's process, noting prior 16 months under Conservative administration and that GBN has shortlisted four technologies. Key discussions are ongoing, aiming for springtime decisions.
    Context: Responding to Baroness Bloomfield's inquiry on delays
Keywords: GBN process, shortlisting technologies, nuclear discussions, Conservative administration

Lord Jones (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Jones raised concerns about the economically deprived areas in north-west Wales, specifically the dormant Wylfa and Trawsfynydd sites. He argues for investment due to high-quality job prospects nuclear sites provide.
    
Keywords: Wylfa nuclear site, Trawsfynydd site, north-west Wales, investment in nuclear, job creation

Lord Hunt of Kings Heath (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Hunt acknowledged the potential for high-quality jobs that new nuclear sites like Wylfa could bring, and mentioned ongoing efforts to make siting policies more flexible to explore future opportunities.
    Context: Response to Lord Jonesâ€™ call for nuclear investment in Wales
Keywords: nuclear job creation, nuclear siting policy, Wylfa redevelopment, future opportunities

Lord Ravensdale (Crossbench, Excepted Hereditary):
    Lord Ravensdale expressed concern about reliance on Russian nuclear fuel and inquired about plans to legislate for a near-term ban on Russian imports for security and industry benefits.
    
Keywords: Russian nuclear fuel, import ban, national security, nuclear industry, fuel legislation

Lord Hunt of Kings Heath (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Hunt confirmed discussions about moving the 2030 cut-off for Russian fuel imports forward, considering international agreements and U.S. actions.
    Context: Response to Lord Ravensdale's query on Russian fuel ban
Keywords: Russian fuel cut-off, international agreements, nuclear fuel security

Lord Wigley (Plaid Cymru, Life peer):
    Lord Wigley highlighted a feasibility study for a radioisotope production plant at Trawsfynydd, funded by Welsh Government and Egino, to address global shortages and enhance local economy with SMR relevance.
    
Keywords: radioisotope production, Trawsfynydd SMR relevance, Welsh Government, healthcare supply, local economic boost

Lord Hunt of Kings Heath (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Hunt acknowledged the merit of establishing a radioisotope plant in Trawsfynydd and mentioned ongoing discussions with Welsh Government and Department of Health but noted no definitive outcomes yet.
    Context: Response to Lord Wigley's proposal for a radioisotope plant
Keywords: radioisotope plant, Welsh Government discussions, nuclear site development

Earl Russell (Liberal Democrat, Excepted Hereditary):
    Earl Russell brought up an agreement with the United States to expedite advanced nuclear technology deployment to aid industry decarbonisation by 2030, and sought confirmation of its importance and potential deployment.
    
Keywords: advanced nuclear technology, US-UK agreement, industry decarbonisation, nuclear deployment

Lord Hunt of Kings Heath (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Hunt described the US agreement as crucial to enhancing civil nuclear relations and noted new global commitments to increase nuclear power by 2050, reflecting a global nuclear renaissance.

Keywords: SMR advantages, nuclear technology, UK industrial potential

Lord Spellar (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Spellar expressed frustration over delays in reactor development and emphasised the need for the existing UK nuclear contractor, which services submarines, to also serve the civil sector and compete internationally as the US is advancing rapidly.
    
Keywords: nuclear reactor development, UK contractor capabilities, international competitiveness, US nuclear advancement

Lord Hunt of Kings Heath (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Hunt reassured that the UK's nuclear development pace is appropriate, highlighting synergy between civil and defence sectors, and stressing the importance of leveraging technological strengths.
