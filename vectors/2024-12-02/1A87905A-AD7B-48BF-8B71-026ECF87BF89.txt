Tone: contentious

Summary:
The parliamentary debate on inheritance tax reforms affecting agricultural property relief (APR) highlighted significant division between parties, with the Government defending the need for fiscal responsibility and tough decisions following a claimed £22 billion fiscal black hole inherited from the previous administration.
Conservative MPs and farming interest groups have argued fiercely against the policy, labeling it as a 'family farm tax' that unfairly threatens the viability of many farms by forcing sales to meet tax liabilities, while the Government insists the majority of family farms will remain unaffected by the changes.
While there was cross-party recognition of the agricultural sector's vital role in the UK economy and a shared commitment to ensuring its sustainable future, the debate remained largely contentious with limited signals of compromise or adjustment from the Government despite criticism over potential oversight in impact assessment and engagement.

Key Points:
Lindsay Hoyle (Speaker, Chorley):
    The Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, announced that an amendment in the name of the Prime Minister had been selected.
    

Victoria Atkins (Conservative, Louth and Horncastle):
    Victoria Atkins criticised the government for breaking promises to farmers by cutting Agricultural Property Relief and Business Property Relief, resulting in significant inheritance tax burdens. She mentioned conflicting government data on affected farms and an absence of an impact assessment. According to the National Farmers’ Union, three-quarters of farms will be affected, forcing some to sell parts of their land. She called for the government to stop these cuts to preserve family farming traditions.
    

Jim Shannon (Democratic Unionist Party, Strangford):
    Jim Shannon indicated that the debate was significant for his constituents and expressed concern over the tax's impact in Northern Ireland, with professional advice suggesting it affects 65% of small and family farms.
    Context: In response to Victoria Atkins's argument about the tax's wide impact.

Alison Hume (Labour, Scarborough and Whitby):
    Alison Hume criticised the opposition member Victoria Atkins for her record in government and questioned her lack of support for the current government's steps towards economic stability.
    Context: In direct criticism of Victoria Atkins following Atkins's speech.

Simon Hoare (Conservative, North Dorset):
    Simon Hoare raised a procedural point about reading speeches, criticising Alison Hume’s intervention as not spontaneous.
    Context: Following Alison Hume's critical intervention.

Victoria Atkins (Conservative, Louth and Horncastle):
    Victoria Atkins questioned Labour's factual understanding regarding the £3 million tax-free transfer claims, pointing out specific demographic limitations and criticising Labour for misleading figures.
    Context: Continuing her criticism of Labour's proposed tax changes.

Helena Dollimore (Labour (Co-op), Hastings and Rye):
    Helena Dollimore accused the previous government of failing to spend £300 million of the farming budget, implying poor management of funds meant for helping farmers.
    Context: In response to Victoria Atkins's criticism of the current Labour policy.

Roger Gale (Conservative, Herne Bay and Sandwich):
    Sir Roger Gale and Sir John Hayes expressed explicit opposition to the Government's approach, pointing out betrayal and the breaking of pre-election promises on tax policy.
    Context: In support of Victoria Atkins's criticism of the government's new tax policies.
Supported by: John Hayes (Conservative, South Holland and The Deepings)

James Murray (Labour (Co-op), Ealing North):
    James Murray moved an amendment appreciating farmers' contributions and defending the government's commitment of £5 billion to the farming budget, citing fiscal responsibility and changes to Agricultural Property Relief and Business Property Relief to address fairness.
    Context: Amending the original motion against the Labour government's tax changes.

John Hayes (Conservative, South Holland and The Deepings):
    Sir John Hayes questioned the Labour Government's claim of only 27% farm impact, countering with the NFU's 75% figure, and requested more detailed modelling to support the government's claims.
    Context: Raising a challenge to James Murray's defence of Labour's tax changes.

Caroline Johnson (Conservative, Sleaford and North Hykeham):
    Dr Caroline Johnson illustrated the emotional burden the inheritance tax changes would place on farmers, framing it as a "tax on tragedy."
    Context: As part of the opposition to Labour's tax policy on farm inheritance.

James Murray (Labour (Co-op), Ealing North):
    James Murray attempted to clarify the inheritance tax impact data, emphasising that many farms would remain unaffected based on HMRC claims data rather than total farm value.
    Context: In response to questions and criticisms of Labour's tax figures.

Tim Farron (Liberal Democrat, Westmorland and Lonsdale):
    Tim Farron criticised both Labour and Conservatives, pointing out the latter's mismanagement and previous promises to farmers. He urged more significant support for sustainable farming and food production.
    Context: Discussing the broader context of farming challenges beyond the inheritance tax issue.
