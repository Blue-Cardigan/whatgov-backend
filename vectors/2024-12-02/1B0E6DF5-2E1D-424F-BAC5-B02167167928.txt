Key Points:
Zarah Sultana (Independent, Coventry South):
    Zarah Sultana presented a petition against the UK's decision to increase the national bus fare cap from £2 to £3 in 2025. The current £2 cap, implemented in January 2020, has been crucial during the cost-of-living crisis, facilitating access to essential services like work, healthcare, and family visits. An increase is expected to add significant costs for commuters and risk isolating vulnerable individuals. The petition emphasises maintaining affordable public transport past 2025 by opposing the proposed fare increase.
