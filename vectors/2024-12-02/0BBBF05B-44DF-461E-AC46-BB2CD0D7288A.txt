Summary:
The UK government has committed to doubling its aid to Sudan to £226 million, aiming to address the severe humanitarian crisis and support neighboring countries hosting refugees by providing crucial resources such as food, water, and healthcare.
Both Conservative and Labour peers expressed bipartisan support for increased aid and diplomatic efforts, emphasising the urgent need for the protection of children and the promotion of civilian-led governance in Sudan, while condemning the Russian veto that blocked a UN resolution aimed at enhancing civilian protection.
Despite challenges in aid delivery due to restrictions imposed by warring factions, the UK leadership, alongside international partners, remains steadfast in leveraging diplomatic channels and supporting civil society to foster peace and stability in the region.
