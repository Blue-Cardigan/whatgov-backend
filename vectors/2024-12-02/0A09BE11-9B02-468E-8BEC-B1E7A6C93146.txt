Key Points:
Stuart Anderson (Conservative, South Shropshire):
    Stuart Anderson raised a point of order regarding a statement made by the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury in a previous debate, claiming that the Office for Budget Responsibility had used the word 'cover-up' in reference to the actions of the previous Government. Anderson asserted that after checking with the OBR, this was not the case and suggested that the statement was a creative use of words to suit a political narrative. He sought advice on how to bring the Minister to the House to correct the record.
    

Lindsay Hoyle (Speaker, Chorley):
    Sir Lindsay Hoyle responded to Stuart Anderson's point of order, stating that the Chair is not responsible for what Ministers say in the Chamber and acknowledged Anderson's effort to put the record straight from his perspective. He noted that those on the Treasury Bench would have heard Anderson's remarks and would reflect on them. Although he didn't provide a direct mechanism for correcting the record, he appreciated Anderson's initiative in notifying the Exchequer Secretary.
