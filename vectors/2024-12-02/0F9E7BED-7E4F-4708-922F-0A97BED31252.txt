Summary:
A robust discussion unfolded in the House of Lords over new government measures to tackle anti-social behaviour, with proposals for 'Respect Orders' and increased policing funding at its core.
Key issues raised included the effectiveness of new orders compared to existing police powers, the operational capacity of law enforcement and judicial systems, and broader societal support frameworks.
While generally supportive of increased efforts against anti-social behaviour, opposition concerns focused on practical implementation, potential criminalization of vulnerable groups, and the adequacy of current government funding commitments.
