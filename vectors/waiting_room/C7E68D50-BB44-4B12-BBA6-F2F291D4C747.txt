Key Points:
Lord Hunt of Kings Heath (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Hunt of Kings Heath introduces the Contracts for Difference (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2024, emphasising their importance in the government's strategy to boost low-carbon electricity generation in the UK. The contracts for difference (CfD) scheme is the primary mechanism supporting new low-carbon projects. The sixth allocation round awarded contracts to 128 clean energy projects amounting to 9.6 gigawatts, equating to power for 11 million homes. The amendments propose extending phased contracts to floating offshore wind and making repowered onshore wind projects eligible for CfDs.

Earl Russell (Liberal Democrat, Excepted Hereditary):
    Earl Russell supports the amendment and questions the government on measures to ensure consumer value for money within these contracts and the balance of value in the repowering process between government interests and onshore wind development.

Lord Offord of Garvel (Conservative, Life peer):
    Lord Offord of Garvel expresses support for the draft regulations, highlighting their role in supporting further construction in the wind sector. He emphasises that CfDs derisk renewable projects like wind farms, which have high initial costs. He acknowledges the previous effectiveness of CfDs since 2014 in contributing to the net zero goal.

Lord Hunt of Kings Heath (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Hunt of Kings Heath responds to questions, emphasising that value for money is crucial. He notes that onshore wind (ONW) has a competitive clearing price and anticipates repowering will boost competition, leading to lower prices and consumer savings. Additionally, he addresses potential nuclear extensions, hinting at comprehensive support for extending operational capacities where feasible.
    Context: Response to Earl Russell's questions about consumer value for money.
