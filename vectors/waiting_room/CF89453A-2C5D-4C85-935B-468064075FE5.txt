Tone: contentious

Summary:
Labour's Yvette Cooper sharply criticised the former Conservative government's handling of migration, highlighting soaring net migration and asylum system costs, alongside a lack of border enforcement.
The newly introduced Labour policies focus on reducing net migration through tighter visa controls and increased training for domestic workers, alongside enhanced international cooperation to tackle people smuggling networks.
Ministerial commitments include ongoing international collaborations with Iraq on border security and a forthcoming White Paper to reform the migration system, setting a more controlled and strategic approach to labor market dependencies.
