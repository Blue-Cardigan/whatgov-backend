Summary:
The debate centred on the proposed English devolution White Paper, which promises to empower local communities by transferring authority from Westminster to local entities better equipped to address regional needs.
A key proposal discussed was the 'community right to buy,' which would allow locals to take ownership of important community assets; however, questions were raised about the guidance and support needed for local authorities to implement these changes effectively.
Concerns about the impact of developers' viability calculations on social housing were also addressed, with a reassurance that the government is considering reforms that could align housing policies with community empowerment goals.
