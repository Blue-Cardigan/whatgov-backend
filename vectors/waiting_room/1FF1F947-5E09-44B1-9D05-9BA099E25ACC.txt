Key Points:
Lord Londesborough (Crossbench, Excepted Hereditary):
    Lord Londesborough raised concerns about the significant drop in fundraising for start-ups, with the quarterly figure falling by almost 50% to a six-year low. He attributes this decline to measures including increased capital gains tax, employers' national insurance, and minimum wage hikes. He questions the timeline for measures to promote job creation and risk-taking, and inquires about the Chancellor's promise to maintain the most pro-growth Treasury in history.
    

Lord Leong (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Leong acknowledged the reduction in start-up funding rounds and noted the transition from a period characterised by the 'fear of missing out' on investments. He highlighted angel investments such as the EIS, which continue to offer robust tax rebates, underscored by the Chancellor's assurance of their continuation to 2035. He outlined the Government's new modern industrial strategy, "Invest 2035," aimed at growth in high-potential sectors, and reiterated that a small business strategy would be published next year to further support entrepreneurship and create a conducive business environment.
    Context: Responding to Lord Londesborough's concerns about start-up funding and policy measures.

Lord Clarke of Nottingham (Conservative, Life peer):
    Lord Clarke of Nottingham stressed the importance of demonstrating economic competence and fiscal discipline to attract investment. He criticised the Government's promise to avoid raising basic taxes, which he argues undermines fiscal responsibility and deters investment due to rising debt. He emphasised the need for government accountability in managing debt and maintaining attractive investment conditions.
    Context: In response to overall government economic policies and the issue of attracting investments.

Lord Leong (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Leong responded that most UK businesses would not be affected by tax rises and referenced historical economic challenges. He emphasised the Labour Government's efforts to stabilise the economy and highlighted their commitment to being a pro-business and pro-worker government, aiming to provide consistency and certainty to investors and entrepreneurs.
    Context: In response to Lord Clarke of Nottingham's call for economic competence and fiscal discipline.

Lord Sahota (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Sahota expressed concern over low footfall and viability issues faced by small high street businesses, even during peak shopping periods. He asked about measures to support the high streets and encourage their sustainability within communities.
    Context: Concerned with challenges faced by high street businesses and looking for supportive measures.

Lord Leong (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Leong outlined new measures from the Budget aimed at supporting high streets, such as freezing the small business multiplier and reducing business rates for specific sectors. He spoke about empowering local councils to rejuvenate town centres and promoting access to finance for small businesses, with planned funding allocations in the near future to boost local economies and community spaces.
    Context: In response to Lord Sahota's concerns about high street businesses and their sustainability.

Lord Fox (Liberal Democrat, Life peer):
    Lord Fox questioned the impact of recent NIC increases on small businesses and whether this decision was influenced by a preference for short-term revenue over long-term growth. He sought clarification on whether this was a calculated decision by the Treasury and its implications for business investment and innovation.
    Context: Following up on the discussion of national insurance contributions and their impact on small businesses.

Lord Leong (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Leong refrained from delving into Treasury-specific reasoning but assured that most small businesses would not be affected by the NIC rise. He stressed the importance of confidence in attracting investment and mentioned various tax reliefs available to businesses, including EIS, SEIS, and VCT, which provide significant tax advantages and access to alternative funding mechanisms.
    Context: Responding to Lord Fox's inquiry about NIC impacts and Treasury decisions related to business growth.

Lord Brownlow of Shurlock Row (Conservative, Life peer):
    Lord Brownlow questioned the collapse in market and business confidence despite government assurances, citing personal experience in entrepreneurship and significant tax contributions from his ventures.
    Context: Speaking on perceived discrepancies between government assurances and actual business climate.

Lord Leong (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Leong defended the Government's stance by mentioning the recent International Investment Summit, which demonstrated significant investment pledges, indicating market confidence in the UK. He highlighted the large cash reserves and growing dividends of FTSE 100 companies, suggesting that economic stability benefits businesses and employees alike.
    Context: In response to Lord Brownlow's concerns about market and business confidence.

Baroness Neville-Rolfe (Conservative, Life peer):
    Baroness Neville-Rolfe questioned whether the increase in capital gains tax makes the UK less attractive for entrepreneurship. She suggested that these tax policies might discourage business creation.
    Context: Raising concerns about tax policies affecting entrepreneurship attractiveness.

Lord Leong (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Leong contended that UK remains an attractive place for entrepreneurship despite national insurance increases. He argued that the country's status as a start-up hub is underlined by its appeal to innovative people wanting to establish businesses, maintaining that fundamental business opportunities outweigh minor tax considerations.
    Context: In response to Baroness Neville-Rolfe's point on taxes affecting business start-ups.
