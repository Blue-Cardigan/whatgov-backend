Summary:
During a detailed examination of the Football Governance Bill, peers argued over expanding the Bill's definition of "sustainability" to encompass broader ethical, social, and environmental responsibilities, with concerns about diverting the regulator's focus from core functions.
There were significant philosophical differences over regulatory intrusion, highlighted by debate on whether fans' voices and club duties should extend globally or remain locally focused.
While acknowledging the voluntary positive social impact of clubs, peers questioned statutory impositions on corporate responsibilities, indicating ongoing tensions about the scope of regulatory powers.
