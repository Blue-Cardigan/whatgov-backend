Tone: contentious

Summary:
The debate on family farming in Devon brought forth bipartisan concerns about the government's budget impacts, centering on the economic viability and sustainability of family farms, particularly with changes to inheritance taxation and farm support schemes.
Farmers' representatives highlighted challenges linked to reduced basic payments and postponed grants, arguing that these, along with proposed inheritance tax reforms, threaten traditional farming structures and rural economies.
While the government sought to reassure with planned support through environmental schemes and a renewed focus on biosecurity, there was a clear call for more tailored solutions and engagement, especially as mental health concerns among farmers grow due to economic pressures.

Key Points:
Geoffrey Cox (Conservative, Torridge and Tavistock):
    Sir Geoffrey Cox opens the debate, emphasising the specific challenges and contributions of family farms in Devon. He highlights the cultural and historical importance of these farms, noting their economic output of £1.369 billion and their role in sustaining rural life through livestock and dairy farming.
    

Geoffrey Cox (Conservative, Torridge and Tavistock):
    Cox discusses the current financial challenges faced by Devon's family farmers, particularly focusing on the significant decreases in farm incomes for dairy and livestock farms due to falling prices and cuts to basic payment schemes. He asserts that these farmers farm for the love of it and the lifestyle, not for wealth accumulation.
    

Geoffrey Cox (Conservative, Torridge and Tavistock):
    Cox criticises recent political decisions impacting farmers, mentioning accelerated budget cuts to farm payments, challenges with the environmental land management scheme, and postponed stewardship schemes, which have left farmers unable to plan effectively due to financial unpredictability.
    

Geoffrey Cox (Conservative, Torridge and Tavistock):
    Cox highlights the impact of the government’s changes to agricultural and business property relief, noting that the new cap will dramatically affect farmers’ ability to pass their farms to the next generation. He warns that these taxes will force many families to sell parts of their farms, damaging their operations.
    

Daniel Zeichner (Labour, Cambridge):
    Daniel Zeichner indicates disagreement when Cox asks about stopped capital grants, suggesting that there might be discrepancies in the government's claimed support for farmers.
    

Geoffrey Cox (Conservative, Torridge and Tavistock):
    Cox expresses concerns about double-cab pick-up trucks being reclassified for tax purposes, which adds unexpected costs to farming operations. He argues that such measures demonstrate the government’s true preferences and priorities, which he perceives as neglectful of farmers' needs.
    

Geoffrey Cox (Conservative, Torridge and Tavistock):
    Cox calls for a careful and continued approach to controlling bovine TB in Devon, warning against any premature cessation of current disease control measures. He supports a variety of methods but emphasises the need for evidence-led decision-making in applying them.
    

Jim Shannon (Democratic Unionist Party, Strangford):
    Jim Shannon echoes concerns about the impact of inheritance tax on farms. He emphasises the importance of food security and the unique value farming adds to the community and national economy, mentioning his own involvement with the farming community in Strangford.
    Context: In response to Cox's points on the implications of inheritance tax.

Rebecca Smith (Conservative, South West Devon):
    Rebecca Smith highlights the specific challenges faced by farms in South West Devon, focusing on farm size and inheritance challenges. She adds that smaller farms have tighter margins and calls for flexibility in agriculture schemes to accommodate the needs of these farms.
    Context: Supporting Cox's discussion on economic difficulties for family farms.

Richard Foord (Liberal Democrat, Honiton and Sidmouth):
    Richard Foord shares personal storeys from constituents in mid and east Devon facing uncertainty over future farm inheritances due to new tax changes, emphasising the long-term impacts on farming families and the potential loss of farming heritage.
    Context: Adding to the inheritance tax concerns raised by Cox.

Danny Chambers (Liberal Democrat, Winchester):
    Dr. Danny Chambers discusses broader issues facing Devon farmers, including mental health and border biosecurity. He questions the impact of illegal meat imports and calls for improved border enforcement to protect the livestock industry.
    Context: Building on the theme of protecting farming communities and economies in Devon.

Caroline Voaden (Liberal Democrat, South Devon):
    Caroline Voaden critiques the government's tax changes on the farming industry, warning they might force farmers to sell land and reduce food production. She shares survey responses that indicate widespread fear and opposition to the inheritance tax changes among farmers.
    Context: Supporting Cox's points on the impact of inheritance tax.

Robbie Moore (Conservative, Keighley and Ilkley):
    Robbie Moore criticises government-induced uncertainties for farmers, particularly regarding payment and grant schemes, and argues against a perceived 'family farm tax.' He accuses the government of inconsistency, which he claims will harm small and cash-strapped farms.
    Context: Supporting Cox's critical view of current government farming policies.

Daniel Zeichner (Labour, Cambridge):
    Daniel Zeichner defends the government's agricultural policies, explaining accelerated changes to payments aim to end non-productive subsidies for landowners. He dismisses opposition claims about the adverse effect of inheritance tax changes on farms, citing Treasury estimates that suggest limited impact.
    Context: In rebuttal to concerns raised by Cox and Moore about tax policy impact.
Opposed by: Geoffrey Cox (Conservative, Torridge and Tavistock), Robbie Moore (Conservative, Keighley and Ilkley)

Geoffrey Cox (Conservative, Torridge and Tavistock):
    Sir Geoffrey Cox closes by expressing dissatisfaction with the government's justification of inheritance tax impacts, emphasising the personal toll on farmers in his community. He critiques Treasury's lack of consideration for the complex realities of family farms and urges a collaborative approach to agricultural challenges.
