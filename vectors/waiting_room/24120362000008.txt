Summary:
The UK Government has announced new regulations to restrict advertising for less healthy foods, imposing a 9 pm watershed for television and 24-hour online restrictions, in line with the Health and Care Act 2022.
This measure, confirmed after a recent consultation, extends to IPTV services regulated by Ofcom, with the intention of reducing childhood obesity by removing 7.2 billion calories annually from children's diets.
Businesses have been provided with detailed guidance to prepare for the implementation by October 2025, marking a significant step in addressing public health concerns and NHS cost reductions linked to obesity.

Key Points:
Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    The UK Government is focusing on reducing childhood obesity by introducing advertising restrictions on less healthy foods and drinks. New regulations will enforce a 9 pm television watershed and 24-hour online advertising ban for these products. These measures should help reduce children's calorie intake by 7.2 billion per year, potentially lowering the number of children with obesity by 20,000. This supports the Government's goal of fostering the healthiest generation of children.
    

Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    The new regulations fall under the Health and Care Act 2022, amending the Communications Act 2003. IPTV services regulated by Ofcom will adhere to a 9 pm watershed for advertising similar to other broadcast TV services. Additionally, guidance will be published for the industry concerning affected food and drink categories to aid compliance by October 2025.
    

Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    The Government's actions are aligned with their pledge to control junk food advertising promptly. Such measures are seen as a preventive strategy to tackle obesity-related health issues, which are notably the UK's second largest preventable cancer cause and cost the health service over Â£11 billion annually.
