Key Points:
Douglas Alexander (Labour (Co-op), Lothian East):
    The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) held its eighth commission meeting in Vancouver, where it was decided to begin the accession process for Costa Rica. This process will involve creating an accession working group since Costa Rica meets the "Auckland principles" of high standards, compliance with trade commitments, and consensus among CPTPP parties.
    

Douglas Alexander (Labour (Co-op), Lothian East):
    The commencement of Costa Rica's accession process emphasises that CPTPP is a dynamic agreement intended to grow by including economies that uphold high standards. The first meeting of the accession working group is scheduled for early 2025 under Australia’s chairmanship, and the UK will continue to discuss other accession requests as per the Auckland principles alongside Costa Rica's process.
    

Douglas Alexander (Labour (Co-op), Lothian East):
    The UK Department for Business and Trade is launching an eight-week public engagement period starting today, to gather stakeholder views on Costa Rica's accession, ending on January 24, 2025. Stakeholders are invited to share their perspectives on issues and terms related to Costa Rica’s CPTPP membership through an online questionnaire.
    

Douglas Alexander (Labour (Co-op), Lothian East):
    CPTPP Ministers discussed the general review of the agreement during the meeting, summarised in the "Vancouver statement". The general review aims to explore potential updates to the agreement to address modern trade and investment challenges. A factual summary of public feedback from January to February 2024 will guide the ongoing review.
    

Douglas Alexander (Labour (Co-op), Lothian East):
    The UK will officially join the CPTPP on December 15, 2024, with the agreement coming into force with Japan, Singapore, Chile, New Zealand, Vietnam, Peru, Malaysia, and Brunei. Australia has recently ratified the UK's accession, starting its bilateral force on December 24, 2024. For other countries, entry into force will occur 60 days post-ratification. This accession highlights the global scope of CPTPP and its potential benefits for UK businesses.
