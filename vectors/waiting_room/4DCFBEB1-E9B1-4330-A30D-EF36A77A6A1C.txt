Tone: contentious

Summary:
The debate highlighted severe deficiencies in the statutory framework for home-to-school transport for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND), focusing on the policy's lack of consistency and support during critical educational phases for children aged five and post-16.
Cross-party contributions emphasised the immense financial burden on local authorities and families, with calls for increased funding, more localised SEND provision, and a reevaluation of statutory obligations to include children before school age and between ages 16 to 19.
In response, the government committed to reviewing the current transport framework, acknowledging the urgent need for a more inclusive and efficient system that reduces dependence on long-distance travel for SEND education, yet details on immediate implementation or funding adjustments were scarce.
