Tone: collaborative

Summary:
The Lords highlighted cross-party concerns regarding the rise in retail crime, emphasising its impact on retail workers and local economies, and stressed the need for robust legislative actions, including the introduction of harsher penalties for shoplifting and specific offences for assaults on retail workers.
Commitments were made to introduce new legislation aiming to create a specific offence of violence against retail workers and to remove the £200 threshold for theft prosecution, alongside increasing police presence at retail crime hotspots.
The collaborative debate underscored the need for comprehensive measures, including better data collection, coordination of efforts at police and community levels, and ethical applications of new technologies like facial recognition to ensure workers' safety and community well-being.

Key Points:
Lord Hannett of Everton (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Hannett of Everton highlighted the issue of retail crime and its significant impact on workers, communities, and local economies. He praised the USDAW's Freedom From Fear campaign, which he previously introduced, aimed at protecting retail workers from violence and abuse. Notably, he cited a significant increase in retail crime driven by organised gangs and mentioned a new law in Scotland meant to protect shop workers. Furthermore, Lord Hannett criticised the insufficient changes to sentencing guidelines in England and Wales, underscoring the need for a stand-alone offence of assaulting a retail worker in England, similar to Scotland's law. He welcomed additional government funding for tackling retail crime but emphasised the need for more comprehensive legislative measures, such as the removal of the £200 threshold for prosecuting shoplifters, and advocated for better coordination between police and retailers to handle career criminals effectively.

Lord Kirkham (Conservative, Life peer):
    Lord Kirkham shared his experiences as a retailer and highlighted the severity of organised retail crime. He expressed concern over the inadequacy of current police responses and the challenges faced by security guards in handling offenders. Lord Kirkham criticised the Information Commissioner’s Office for inhibiting retailers from sharing photos of shoplifters, calling for prioritising staff and customer safety above criminals' privacy. He suggested measures such as enabling security guards with more authority and the use of technologies like facial recognition to deter thefts. His call to action included removing the £200 shoplifting threshold and enforcing existing laws on assaults with more rigour. He emphasised the broader economic impacts of retail crime, affecting both pricing and the retail environment.
