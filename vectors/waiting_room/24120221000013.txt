Summary:
The UK Government's remediation acceleration plan introduces firm deadlines for cladding removal by 2029, along with penalties for landlords, aiming to resolve the cladding crisis post-Grenfell swiftly.
This initiative demands developers accelerate assessments, complete remedial works earlier, and cooperate with social landlords, splitting costs to alleviate the financial burden on social sector tenants and leaseholders.
A building safety levy starting in 2025 and collaboration with local government and regulators underscore the Government's commitment to redress safety shortcomings without further taxing residents; new legislation will bolster these corrective measures.

Key Points:
Angela Rayner (Labour, Ashton-under-Lyne):
    Angela Rayner emphasised that more than seven years after the Grenfell Tower tragedy, many buildings in England remain with unsafe cladding. Only 30% of buildings identified have been fixed, causing distress and financial burdens for residents. She announced the setting of firm targets to remediate buildings; by 2029, all buildings 18 meters and above with unsafe cladding in a government-funded scheme will be fixed, and all buildings 11 meters and above will have been remediated or have a completion date, failing which landlords will face severe penalties.

Angela Rayner (Labour, Ashton-under-Lyne):
    Angela Rayner introduced a remediation acceleration plan which outlines measures to expedite the repair of buildings with unsafe cladding. The plan includes introducing legal obligations on landlords to fix cladding with penalties for inaction, empowering metro mayors to lead local plans, and increasing funding for social landlords starting April 2025 to begin repairs earlier.

Angela Rayner (Labour, Ashton-under-Lyne):
    The plan requires developers to meet targets by assessing all buildings by July 2025, initiating or completing remedial works on 80% of their buildings by July 2026, and on all unsafe buildings by July 2027. Developers need to significantly increase their current pace, and at least 28 developers have committed to this joint plan, covering over 95% of necessary buildings.

Angela Rayner (Labour, Ashton-under-Lyne):
    The remediation plan ensures that the burden of fixing historical building safety defects won't fall on leaseholders by introducing a building safety levy, effective autumn 2025, projected to raise £3.4 billion for remediation by charging new eligible residential buildings in England.

Angela Rayner (Labour, Ashton-under-Lyne):
    Angela Rayner highlighted the complexity in identifying unsafe buildings due to the lack of a single comprehensive building register. She announced plans to review 175,000 Ordnance Survey building records by March 2025 to identify buildings at risk, intending to reach 80% coverage by 2025's end, and called for new legislation to improve building safety assessment and registration.

Angela Rayner (Labour, Ashton-under-Lyne):
    The government will support residents financially by allowing leaseholders to sublet their properties at market rates, reducing insurance costs through work with insurance industries, extending the waking watch replacement fund, and launching a public consultation for a fair insurance fees system for leaseholders.

Angela Rayner (Labour, Ashton-under-Lyne):
    To address criticisms from the Grenfell inquiry, the government will prevent companies found culpable in the tragedy from obtaining government contracts and is committing to wide-ranging construction product reforms including liabilities, sanctions, and penalties against manufacturers.
