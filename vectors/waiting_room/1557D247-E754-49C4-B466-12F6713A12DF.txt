Tone: contentious

Summary:
The debate on the future of farming in Westminster Hall brought sharp focus to the proposed inheritance tax reforms, with fears voiced by DUP members that such changes could devastate family-run farms and affect food security across the UK.
Labour representatives defended the tax reform initiative, arguing it targets speculative land purchasers rather than genuine farmers, and highlighted the Government's pledge of £5 billion for the farming sector to support sustainable agriculture.
Despite cross-party concerns over labor shortages and environmental regulations, Labour insisted on the fairness of these changes, while calls for tax relief exemptions for active farmers resulted in no immediate commitments from ministers, indicating ongoing discord.
