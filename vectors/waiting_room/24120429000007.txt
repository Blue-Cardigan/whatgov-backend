Key Points:
Seema Malhotra (Labour (Co-op), Feltham and Heston):
    The Home Office is transitioning to a fully digital border and immigration system leveraging e-visas, which have been used by over 6 million people. These e-visas are designed to increase security and efficiency, and minimise physical document issues like loss or damage. Additionally, they enable secure sharing of immigration status with parties such as employers and government departments. The roll-out is being handled incrementally, with support for users transitioning from traditional documents such as biometric residence permits (BRPs) that will expire by the end of 2024.

Seema Malhotra (Labour (Co-op), Feltham and Heston):
    Statistically, over 3.1 million people have transitioned to e-visas as of November, mostly those with biometric residence permits. Some users face difficulties in creating accounts due to lack of ID documents, leading to interventions like automatic account creation for refugees. Previous administrations were critiqued for not managing transition risks well. The current government is addressing concerns to avoid situations like the Windrush scandal and adjusting roll-out strategies based on stakeholder feedback.

Seema Malhotra (Labour (Co-op), Feltham and Heston):
    Legacy document holders can now more easily apply for "no time limit" status through a streamlined process that automatically creates UKVI accounts. This reduces the evidential burden on applicants and encourages legacy holders to switch to e-visas for benefits despite maintaining their current rights until they choose to transition.
    Context: Discusses the transition for legacy document holders.
Keywords: legacy document holders, no time limit application, e-visa transition, UKVI account creation, evidential burden reduction

Seema Malhotra (Labour (Co-op), Feltham and Heston):
    The Home Office has built technology for automated immigration status cheques by carriers, part of a three-year engagement with airlines to prepare them for e-visas. Increased training and enhanced communication are in place to facilitate the transition, aiming to make the immigration process as simple and secure as possible for travelers.
    Context: Focus on the involvement of carriers and technology development.

Seema Malhotra (Labour (Co-op), Feltham and Heston):
    For BRP holders whose documents expire post-December 31, 2024, the government will allow these to be temporarily used until March 31, 2025, ensuring smoother transition to e-visas and alleviating travel concerns at the year's start. This decision responds to stakeholder feedback, minimising disruptions.
    Context: Response to travel concerns post-BRP expiry.

Seema Malhotra (Labour (Co-op), Feltham and Heston):
    Specialist services are set up to support vulnerable individuals transitioning to e-visas, including grant-funded bodies offering free assistance.

Provisions are in place for digitally excluded customers with assistance services accessible across the UK.
