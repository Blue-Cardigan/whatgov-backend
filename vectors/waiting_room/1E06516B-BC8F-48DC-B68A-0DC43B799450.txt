Key Points:
Hamish Falconer (Labour, Lincoln):
    Mr Hamish Falconer highlighted a major offensive by opposition groups in north-west Syria, particularly Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), who have taken control of Aleppo and Saraqeb. In response, Russian airstrikes have increased and Iranian-aligned groups are aiding the Assad regime. Falconer stressed the urgent need for adherence to international humanitarian law to protect civilians and ensure humanitarian assistance. The UK, along with partners like the US, Germany, and France, called for de-escalation and continuation of a Syrian-led political solution as outlined in UN Security Council resolution 2254. Falconer also noted the challenges in providing consular support and highlighted the UK's financial contributions towards humanitarian aid since 2011, amounting to over £4 billion, with a recent addition of £3 million for emergency assistance in the region.
