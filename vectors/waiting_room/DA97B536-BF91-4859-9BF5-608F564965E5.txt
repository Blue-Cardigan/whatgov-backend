Summary:
The House of Lords debate emphasised the UK's commitment to devolve decision-making over the Shared Prosperity Fund to Welsh representatives, with Minister Alex Norris set to further discuss these issues with his Welsh counterpart imminently.
While Labour representatives voiced concerns over previous funding shortfalls and called for greater regional economic autonomy, Conservative peers questioned the efficiency of extending decision-making powers to the Welsh Senedd.
Ministerial commitments included assurances of transitional funding arrangements and collaborative discussions with Welsh stakeholders, signalling a move towards more locally-driven economic strategies post-2026.
