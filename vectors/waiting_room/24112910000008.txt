Key Points:
Lisa Nandy (Labour, Wigan):
    The Government is providing an update on the funding model for the BBC, which is considered a vital British asset contributing to democracy and community coherence. The Government emphasises the need for sustainable public funding for the BBC amidst a changing media landscape. The forthcoming charter review is an opportunity to adjust the BBC's role and funding to meet these needs and maintain public trust.
    

Lisa Nandy (Labour, Wigan):
    The Government will not proceed with the BBC funding model review initiated by the previous Government. Instead, this issue will be integrated into the charter review process. The unique obligations of the BBC require continued public funding. The approach will involve consultation with broadcasters, stakeholders, and the public as part of the charter review, which is essential before the new charter takes effect in 2028.
    Context: In the context of reviewing the funding model and approach for the BBC as part of adapting to a new media landscape.

Lisa Nandy (Labour, Wigan):
    To ensure stability for the BBC and S4C, the licence fee will increase in line with CPI inflation, amounting to a £5 increase per household, raising the fee to £174.50 from April 2025. This includes a mechanism to predict future TV licence uptake, expected to generate an additional £75 million in licence fee income, supporting BBC and S4C's public service functions.
    Context: Explaining the planned licence fee adjustment to secure financial stability for the BBC and S4C.

Lisa Nandy (Labour, Wigan):
    The Government intends to legislate changes to implement this fee uplift when possible. They are addressing concerns over TV licensing enforcement's impact on vulnerable households, extending the simple payment plan to help more households spread the cost, potentially doubling eligible households to around 500,000 by the end of the charter period.
    Context: Addressing the socio-economic impact of TV licensing on vulnerable groups and ensuring accessibility.
