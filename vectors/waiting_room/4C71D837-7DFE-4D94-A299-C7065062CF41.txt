Summary:
The UK Government is considering reforms to political finance rules, aiming to protect against foreign interference while not limiting domestic fundraising capabilities.
Cross-party Lords raised concerns around transparency, unincorporated associations, and foreign donations, with advocacy for caps on individual contributions and stronger enforcement measures.
