Summary:

The government plans to introduce new legislation to replace the flawed Act and commence inquests halted by previous measures, while reinforcing the independence of the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR).
This parliamentary discussion marked a collaborative tone, with cross-party acknowledgment of the need for comprehensive truth and justice for victims' families, alongside cautious support to address security concerns with the Irish Government collaboratively.
