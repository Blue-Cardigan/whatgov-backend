Key Points:
Dave Doogan (Scottish National Party, Angus and Perthshire Glens):
    Dave Doogan expressed significant concerns about the decommissioning of the radio teleswitch service, which affects 4,665 households in Angus and Perthshire Glens, 80,000 in northern Scotland, and 800,000 across Great Britain. He highlighted that customers dependent on the service for 'total heating with total control' meters would face challenges as the service ends on 30 June 2025. He noted the risks of not transitioning to smart meters, as outlined by Energy UK, which warned that heating and hot water could be uncontrollably left on or off, and tariffs could become unaffordable without the discount these meters offer.
    

Graham Leadbitter (Scottish National Party, Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey):
    Graham Leadbitter shared personal difficulties in transitioning from RTS to smart meters, underscoring the lack of clear communication from energy provider OVO Energy and expressed concerns for more vulnerable individuals facing similar challenges.
