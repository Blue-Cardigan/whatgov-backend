Summary:
The UK government is implementing internationally agreed rules for a 15% minimum effective tax rate on online multinationals, alongside the existing digital services tax targeting online platforms. 
The discussion highlights a Labour proposition to permanently lower taxes for high street businesses, funded by increased tax on properties with high rateable values, aiming to balance competition between physical and online retailers. 
The proposal seeks to safeguard high street businesses by addressing the disparity in tax obligations, though its practical implications for major online retailers like Amazon require careful consideration.
