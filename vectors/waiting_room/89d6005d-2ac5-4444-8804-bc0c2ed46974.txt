Key Points:
Nicholas Dakin (Labour, Scunthorpe):
    Sir Nicholas Dakin introduced the draft Home Detention Curfew and Requisite and Minimum Custodial Periods (Amendment) Order 2024, explaining that it aims to address the capacity crisis in prisons. The Order proposes reducing the automatic release point for certain prisoners and extending the Home Detention Curfew (HDC) period from six months to 12 months. He emphasised that certain offenders, like sex offenders, would remain ineligible for early release.
    

Kieran Mullan (Conservative, Bexhill and Battle):
    Dr Kieran Mullan expressed scepticism about the Government's measures, questioning their effectiveness and whether they are truly temporary solutions as claimed. He criticised the lack of sunset provisions, the absence of victim impact assessment, and the Government's track record with the SDS40 scheme. He stated that these measures might not address the root issues exacerbated by COVID-19.
    Context: Direct response to Sir Nicholas Dakin's introduction of the draft order.
Opposed by: Nicholas Dakin (Labour, Scunthorpe)

Josh Babarinde (Liberal Democrat, Eastbourne):
    Josh Babarinde acknowledged the importance of addressing prison overcrowding by excluding certain offenders from early release but raised concerns over the impact on domestic abuse victims. He questioned how many offenders subject to protection orders have been released and stressed consulting relevant groups for a full assessment. He also urged expanding the Victim Contact Scheme for all victims.
    

Nicholas Dakin (Labour, Scunthorpe):
    Sir Nicholas Dakin assured that the Government takes victims seriously, highlighting that individuals convicted of offenses linked to domestic abuse are ineligible for HDC. He criticised the previous Conservative Government for not implementing exclusions and reiterated the Government's pledge to improve electronic monitoring systems and review the measures in 18 months.
    Context: Response to both Dr Kieran Mullan's and Josh Babarinde's critiques.
