Key Points:
Emma Reynolds (Labour, Wycombe):
    Emma Reynolds stated that due to the government's commitment to the triple lock policy, over 12 million pensioners will see a 4.1% increase in their state pensions next year. Over the current Parliament, these pensioners will be better off by Â£1,900. Additionally, pensioners benefit from free bus passes, eye tests, and prescriptions.
    

Luke Evans (Conservative, Hinckley and Bosworth):
    Dr Luke Evans raised concerns about the processing time for pension credit claims. He noted that in September, one in five claims were not processed within 50 days. Following a written parliamentary question, it was mentioned that additional funding was secured for staffing. However, latest data indicates that one in four claims now exceed 50 days for processing. He questioned the amount of funding provided, if more would be allocated, and how it would be ensured that taxpayers' money is properly spent.

Emma Reynolds (Labour, Wycombe):
    Responding to Dr Luke Evans, Emma Reynolds explained that she has ongoing discussions with officials, being part of both the Treasury and the DWP. She noted a recent campaign to raise awareness about pension credit eligibility, including a TV campaign. Due to a 145% increase in claims from the campaign, processing has been delayed, despite the deployment of an additional 500 staff. She emphasised the government's focus on accelerating the processing time to ensure eligible pensioners receive help.
