Summary:
The debate over the Data (Use and Access) Bill highlighted concerns about introducing new definitions for data holders and traders, prompting calls for clearer terminologies to prevent confusion and overlap with existing data protection terms.
Cross-party agreement was evident on the necessity of ensuring cybersecurity and data integrity for digital verification services and smart data schemes, but differences remained on the specifics of safeguarding measures and governance structures.
Despite support for initiatives like NUAR and 'Tell Us Once,' concerns about engagement with existing providers and the administrative burden on bereaved families respectively were left partly unresolved, with commitments to revisit these issues once technological updates allow.
