Tone: contentious

Summary:
The UK government's strategy to tackle homelessness focuses on increasing the funding for local councils, abolishing no-fault evictions, and boosting social housing builds, with an ambitious £233 million increment aiming to aggregate to nearly £1 billion by the financial year 2025-26.
Contention arose over the effectiveness and sufficiency of these measures, with Labour MPs challenging the impact of historical Conservative reforms and the removal of specific financial protections for homelessness funding.
Despite these tensions, responses from Labour ministers noted a commitment to cross-departmental collaboration and consultation with councils to address the multifaceted nature of homelessness, integrating wider social, economic, and environmental concerns.

Steve Race (Labour, Exeter):
    Steve Race expressed concerns about the implications of the Localism Act 2011, which removed the ring-fence around homelessness funding. He criticised Devon county council for consulting on eliminating its homelessness support budget, which could severely impact Exeter. He emphasised the need to invest in homelessness services instead of redirecting funds elsewhere.

Warinder Juss (Labour, Wolverhampton West):

Clive Jones (Liberal Democrat, Wokingham):
    Clive Jones brought up financial pressures Wokingham borough council is facing, affecting homelessness reduction efforts.

Tim Farron (Liberal Democrat, Westmorland and Lonsdale):
    Tim Farron highlighted a 40% increase in rural homelessness over five years, with a disparity between house prices and local incomes, as well as insufficient housing supply. He proposed giving local authorities planning powers to designate lands for social rented housing, preventing developments for expensive housing.

Paul Holmes (Conservative, Hamble Valley):
    Paul Holmes criticised the government's broken promises on national insurance, impacting homeless charities' funding, projecting a 27% increase in homelessness. He urged the Minister to address the concerns that £50-60 million could be lost, termed as potentially "the final nail in the coffin" for the charity sector. He challenged the government to back investments made for tackling homelessness.
