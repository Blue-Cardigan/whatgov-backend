Key Points:
Luke Pollard (Labour (Co-op), Plymouth Sutton and Devonport):
    Luke Pollard informs the House that the UK Ministry of Defence is extending a contingent liability related to support for Ukraine's armed forces. This is a financial commitment to cover potential legal or associated costs for UK defence industries if sued due to system malfunctions operated by Ukraine's forces.
    

Luke Pollard (Labour (Co-op), Plymouth Sutton and Devonport):
    Pollard explains the UK has been a leader in supporting Ukraine, offering military capabilities to help defend against Russian aggression. The contingent liability arises from legal costs related to potential damage, injury, or death caused by UK-supported systems used by Ukraine's military.
    

Luke Pollard (Labour (Co-op), Plymouth Sutton and Devonport):
    The Ministry of Defence, according to Pollard, is minimising risks, and legal advisers believe the risk of such incidents is low. However, the liability remains unquantifiable over the system's lifespan. Parliament has 14 sitting days to contest the extension.
    

Luke Pollard (Labour (Co-op), Plymouth Sutton and Devonport):
    Pollard notes that the contingent liability was initially established in July during the pre-election period when standard notification procedures could not be followed. This extension is now following the usual parliamentary protocol.
