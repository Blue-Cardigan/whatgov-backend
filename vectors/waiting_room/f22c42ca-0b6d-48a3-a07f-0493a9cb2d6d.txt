Key Points:
Tulip Siddiq (Labour, Hampstead and Highgate):
    The draft order is being considered to adjust the calculation of deficiency relief in light of the new Scottish advanced rate of income tax, which affects a small number of taxpayers who would otherwise be taxed on more than their actual economic gain from certain life insurance policies.
    

Tulip Siddiq (Labour, Hampstead and Highgate):
    The introduction of the Scottish advanced rate income tax band by the Scottish Parliament, effective from 6 April 2024, necessitates adjustments in deficiency relief calculations. The draft order aims to include the new tax band and simplify existing legislation wording.
    

James Wild (Conservative, North West Norfolk):
    The new Scottish income tax rates are 42% for the higher band and 45% for the advanced rate, increasing the complexity of the system to having six rates compared to three in the rest of the UK. The order will align deficiency relief payments accordingly, and there are no plans to oppose it despite the complexity.
    

James Wild (Conservative, North West Norfolk):
    Questions to the minister include the impact of deficiency relief on Exchequer revenues, the precise number of beneficiaries in Scotland, and the timing of response to changes from the Scottish Government.
    

Tulip Siddiq (Labour, Hampstead and Highgate):
    The minister clarifies that the measure affects those paying tax at the Scottish advanced rate and eligible for deficiency relief. She adds that guidance is available through the HMRC Insurance Policyholder Taxation Manual. The expected impact is minimal, with fewer than 10 beneficiaries and an Exchequer impact of less than Â£5 million per annum.
