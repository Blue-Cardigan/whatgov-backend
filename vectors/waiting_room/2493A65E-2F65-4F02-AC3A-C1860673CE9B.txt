Key Points:
Lord Hanson of Flint (Labour, Life peer):
    The UK utilizes various returns agreements and operational arrangements to facilitate the return of individuals who have no legal right to remain in the UK. Efforts to maintain, improve, and develop these processes with foreign governments are ongoing.
    

Lord Hanson of Flint (Labour, Life peer):
    Recent agreement signed with Iraq involves collaboration with both the central government and Kurdish authorities. Details and implications of these agreements, especially considering Syrian hostilities, are yet to be fully disclosed.
    Context: In response to Lord Goodman's query on the newly signed returns agreement with Iraq.
Opposed by: Lord Goodman of Wycombe (Conservative, Life peer)

Lord Hanson of Flint (Labour, Life peer):
    A White Paper on net migration is expected soon, reflecting government focus on net migration issues. Existing return agreements with numerous countries are set to continue.

Opposed by: Lord Austin of Dudley (Non-affiliated, Life peer)

Lord Hanson of Flint (Labour, Life peer):
    The majority of removals since 2007 have been voluntary, which is cheaper and more humane than enforced removal. The government supports voluntary returns and aims to enhance this process through independent advice and support for individuals.
    Context: In response to Lord German's question about the voluntary returns programme.
Opposed by: Lord German (Liberal Democrat, Life peer)

Lord Hanson of Flint (Labour, Life peer):
    Data collection on foreign national offenders who have served more than 12 months in prison and whether they are deported is a point of inquiry. The government reviews incoming completion notifications of sentences for foreign national offenders to ascertain deportation decisions.
    Context: In response to Lord Jackson of Peterborough's complaint about incomplete data collection on foreign national offenders.
Opposed by: Lord Jackson of Peterborough (Conservative, Life peer)

Lord Hanson of Flint (Labour, Life peer):
    There has been no direct communication regarding alleged identity cheques by Irish police on Northern Irish buses. However, UK-Ireland cooperation on common travel area matters continues.
    Context: In response to Baroness Hoey's point about identity cheques by Irish police.
Opposed by: Baroness Hoey (Non-affiliated, Life peer)

Lord Hanson of Flint (Labour, Life peer):
    The government plans to review safeguarding policies concerning enforced return practises to ensure they are humane, in light of an increased rate of return of asylum claimants.
    Context: In response to The Lord Bishop of London's inquiry on safeguarding in enforced returns.
Opposed by: The Lord Bishop of London (Bishops, Bishops)

Lord Hanson of Flint (Labour, Life peer):
    The UK has seen an increased rate of deportations. The total number of deported individuals, their countries of origin, and manner of arrival remain statistical and difficult to confirm individually.
    Context: In response to Lord Evans of Rainow's congratulations and request for deportation specifics.
Opposed by: Lord Evans of Rainow (Conservative, Life peer)

Lord Hanson of Flint (Labour, Life peer):
    Details on the deported individuals' destination countries are extensive and difficult to enumerate in full. Clarification about the death penalty status in Iraq is unknown and will be addressed later.
    Context: In response to Baroness Foster of Oxton's inquiry on deportation details and Iraq.
Opposed by: Baroness Foster of Oxton (Conservative, Life peer)

Lord Hanson of Flint (Labour, Life peer):
    The government is working to counter the issue of individuals concealing their identity to avoid deportation. Recent substantial return flights demonstrate ongoing enforcement efforts.

Opposed by: Lord Faulks (Non-affiliated, Life peer)
