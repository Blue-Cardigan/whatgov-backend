Tone: contentious

Summary:
The debate centred on the proposed hike in employer national insurance contributions, framed as a necessary move to fund public services in the wake of challenging fiscal conditions inherited by the current government.
Labour's proposal to raise national insurance contributions sparked strong opposition from the Conservative and Liberal Democrat benches, citing potential negative impacts on small businesses, healthcare providers, and charities, and a breach of electoral promises.
Despite concerns, Labour defended the increase as crucial for economic stability and public service improvement, underscored by a commitment to NHS investment and enhanced social care funding, though some sectors expressed the need for reconsideration of support measures.
