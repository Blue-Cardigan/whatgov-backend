Summary:

Key Points:
Kirsteen Sullivan (Labour (Co-op), Bathgate and Linlithgow):
    Kirsteen Sullivan brought forward a petition representing UK residents on commercial sexual exploitation. The petition highlights concerns about men paying for sex, which is said to drive a brutal sex trafficking trade, facilitated by pimping websites operating without restriction. The petition requests the House of Commons to urge the Government to outlaw such websites and the act of paying for sex, while suggesting support for victims of sexual exploitation rather than sanctions.
