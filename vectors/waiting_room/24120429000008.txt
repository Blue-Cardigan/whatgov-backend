Summary:
The UK Government has enacted the Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Act 2024, setting a precedent for transitioning passenger rail services from private to public control, beginning with South Western Railway and c2c by mid-2025.
The government emphasises maintaining continuous service quality and safety during the transition, with regulatory oversight from the Department for Transport and the Office of Rail and Road.
The Department for Transport intends to retain existing rail staff and apply TUPE regulations for smooth employment transitions, while also preparing for broader rail reforms under the forthcoming Great British Railways framework.
