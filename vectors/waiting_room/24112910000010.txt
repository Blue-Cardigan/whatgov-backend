Key Points:
Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    The government aims to end new HIV transmissions in England by 2030, with a recent initiative involving emergency department opt-out HIV testing being expanded to high prevalence areas in 2025-26, supported by Â£27 million in funding.
    

Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    The third annual report on the HIV Action Plan monitoring and evaluation framework for 2024 has been published, highlighting the government's progress towards stopping new HIV transmissions by 2030.
    

Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    HIV testing in sexual health services increased by 8% from 2022, with a notable 36% rise among gay, bisexual, and men who have sex with men. New HIV diagnoses in England decreased by 12% from 2019 to 2022 but rose by 15% in 2023.
    

Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    The blood borne virus opt-out testing in emergency departments has been successful in identifying a significant proportion of new HIV diagnoses in 2023.
    

Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    England is one of the few countries meeting the 95-95-95 targets using global metrics. However, UKHSA adjusted these targets to account for those diagnosed but not in active care, and those without viral suppression reporting.
    

Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    In 2023, England met UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals and partially met the 95-95-95 goals, with 96% diagnosed, 94% receiving treatment, and 92% achieving viral suppression.
    

Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    Over half of people living with HIV are over age 50 due to effective treatment.
    

Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    There is increasing inequality in access to HIV prevention, treatment, care, and quality of life, especially by age, ethnicity, gender identity, and exposure. White men saw a 35% drop in new HIV diagnoses, whereas men from ethnic minorities saw an increase from 26% to 33% between 2019 and 2023.
    

Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    There has been an increase in the need for and initiation of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), highest among white GBMSM and lowest among ethnic minority groups like black African and black Caribbean.
    

Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    As the target year for ending HIV transmission approaches, finding all those living with HIV and reducing inequalities will be challenging, requiring efforts across the system.
    

Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    The Department of Health and Social Care, UK Health Security Agency, NHS England, and other partners are using the report evidence to develop a new HIV action plan, aiming to publish it by summer 2025.
    

Andrew Gwynne (Labour (Co-op), Gorton and Denton):
    Andrew Gwynne commits to keeping Parliament informed about progress and requests continued support for making England the first country to end HIV transmission.
