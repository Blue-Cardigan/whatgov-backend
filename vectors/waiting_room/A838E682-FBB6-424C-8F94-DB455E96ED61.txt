Summary:
The UK Government is acting on its commitment to repeal and replace the previous legacy Act concerning the Troubles in Northern Ireland by laying a remedial order to address human rights concerns and promising forthcoming primary legislation.
Cross-party support acknowledges the need for reform, particularly reinstating inquests and civil proceedings, although concerns remain about the independence and operational questioning of the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR).
Significant ministerial commitments include mainlining engagement with families and victims, improving legal frameworks for truth recovery, and ensuring veterans' support, while the government continues to navigate complex legal challenges related to the Windsor Framework.
