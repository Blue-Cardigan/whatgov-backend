Summary:
The Labour party's commitment to reducing UK-EU trade barriers hinges on negotiating an agreement that maintains high animal welfare standards, albeit with an intent to reject past frameworks such as the single market, customs union, and freedom of movement.
Cross-party dialogue reveals a shared interest in improving UK-EU trade relations, with the Liberal Democrats advocating for a UK-EU youth mobility scheme to bolster soft power, though this proposal was met with reluctance from the government.
The session underscores the Labour governmentâ€™s attempts to reset UK-EU relations while emphasising constraints on past alignment policies, despite calls for more dynamic interaction from other parties.
