Key Points:
Lord Hanson of Flint (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Hanson of Flint moved the debate on the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Search, Seizure and Detention of Property: Code of practise) Order 2024, stating it complements the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023. This Act reforms corporate transparency, targeting money laundering and introducing powers to tackle criminal use of crypto assets. The debated order applies these powers in Northern Ireland through a new code of practise, clarifying conditions for their use and ensuring they are applied consistently and proportionately.
