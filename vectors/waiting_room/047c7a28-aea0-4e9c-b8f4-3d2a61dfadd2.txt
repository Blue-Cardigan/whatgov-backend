Type: General Committees
Location: General Committees
House: Commons

Speakers:
- Miatta Fahnbulleh (Labour (Co-op), Peckham)
  Topics: Environment and Natural Resources
  Subtopics: Climate Change and Emissions Policy, Energy Policy and Renewable Resources, Environmental Protection and Conservation
- Andrew Bowie (Conservative, West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)
  Topics: Environment and Natural Resources

Tone: contentious

Summary:
The debate centred on amendments to the Contracts for Difference scheme, aiming to boost offshore wind capacity and promote repowered onshore wind projects, which the Government views as crucial to its clean power goals by 2030.
Critics raised concerns over the rapid pace proposed by the Government, fearing that accelerated offshore wind capacity targets could lead to increased consumer costs, as competitive pricing mechanisms might be compromised.
Ministerial reassurances focused on the long-term consumer benefits of transitioning away from fossil fuels, asserting that the strategic shift would lead to reduced energy bills, despite criticism from industry stakeholders about potential short-term price spikes.

Key Points:
Miatta Fahnbulleh (Labour (Co-op), Peckham):
    Miatta Fahnbulleh introduces the draft Contracts for Difference (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2024, emphasising the need for clean power transition to enhance UK energy security and economic growth while tackling climate change. She outlines the Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme as a key mechanism supporting low-carbon electricity generation through competitive auctions. The sixth CfD round awarded contracts to 128 projects, capturing 9.6 GW of renewable capacity. The proposed amendments aim to extend phased CfDs to floating offshore wind projects and allow repowered onshore wind projects to apply for CfDs.
    

Andrew Bowie (Conservative, West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine):
    Andrew Bowie supports the CfD amendments but expresses concern that aggressive targets for expanding offshore wind capacity could lead to increased consumer bills due to reduced competition in CfD auctions. He warns that the government's push for 60 GW capacity by 2030 might lead to resource constraints and price spikes, thus burdening the consumers. Bowie notes the industry's apprehension about the government policies and records his concern about potential short-term economic implications of the government's energy targets.
    Context: Response to Miatta Fahnbulleh's proposal of CfD amendments.

Miatta Fahnbulleh (Labour (Co-op), Peckham):
    Miatta Fahnbulleh responds to concerns about consumer energy bills, arguing that dependency on fossil fuels has led to high prices. She emphasises the strategic need to shift to clean power to reduce costs and shield families from volatile fossil fuel prices. Fahnbulleh asserts that the current situation is unsustainable and that transitioning to clean power is critical for reducing energy bill burdens, validated by the National Energy System Operator's publication.
    Context: In response to Andrew Bowie's concern about increased consumer bills due to aggressive energy targets.
