Key Points:
Jess Asato (Labour, Lowestoft):
    Jess Asato raises concerns about pimping websites facilitating sex trafficking and exploitation, highlighting that these sites make significant profits from vulnerable women. She presents a petition from Lowestoft constituents urging the government to ban these websites and the act of paying for sex, while providing support, instead of punishment, for victims of sexual exploitation.
    

Jim Shannon (Democratic Unionist Party, Strangford):
    Jim Shannon raises a procedural point regarding a previous debate on the assisted dying Bill. He seeks confirmation that the Bill Committeeâ€™s composition will reflect the House's vote, noting the specific vote totals for and against the Bill. He wants reassurance that this representation will be respected during the Committee formation.
    

Lindsay Hoyle (Speaker, Chorley):
    Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle responds to Jim Shannon, clarifying that determining the composition of the Bill Committee is not within his responsibilities but falls to the Member in charge of the Bill. He encourages Shannon to pursue the matter further with that Member.
