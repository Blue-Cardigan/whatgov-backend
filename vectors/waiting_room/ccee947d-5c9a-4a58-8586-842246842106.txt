    Gareth Thomas presented the draft Companies and Limited Liability Partnerships (Protection and Disclosure of Information and Consequential Amendments) Regulations 2024 to the committee, noting that they form part of the efforts under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023. He highlighted that these regulations aim to implement reforms at Companies House to combat economic crime and enhance transparency, while also addressing risks related to the public disclosure of personal information, such as identity theft and domestic abuse cases. These reforms allow for applications to protect residential addresses previously used as registered office addresses, with specific measures for dissolved companies. Additionally, these regulations ensure that laws applying to limited liability partnerships are aligned with company laws.
