Key Points:
Tessa Munt (Liberal Democrat, Wells and Mendip Hills):
    Tessa Munt raised concerns about non-qualifying leaseholder status, stating it becomes a perpetual issue even after necessary safety works are completed. This status dramatically affects the ability to acquire a mortgage on such properties, which are often flats, leading to advice against purchasing them. Munt questioned the impact of this on the housing crisis.
