Key Points:
Matthew Pennycook (Labour, Greenwich and Woolwich):
    The Government acknowledges the financial pressure that increasing service charges exert on leaseholders, including those under social housing landlords. By law, these charges must be reasonable, and they can be contested through tribunals. The housing ombudsman can examine the fairness of these charges, and further measures are being considered to strengthen leaseholder protections against exorbitant increases.
