Kim Leadbeater (Labour, Spen Valley):

Kevin McKenna (Labour, Sittingbourne and Sheppey):
    Kevin McKenna, with extensive nursing experience, argues that clinicians are skilled in spotting coercion, which is essential to their practise, and supports Kim Leadbeater's view that safeguarding through a legal framework is necessary.
    
Supported by: Kim Leadbeater (Labour, Spen Valley)

Simon Hoare (Conservative, North Dorset):

Opposed by: Kim Leadbeater (Labour, Spen Valley)

    Alicia Kearns supports the Bill, suggesting it minimizes coercion risks and challenges arguments that foresee rampant misuse with a 'six months' prognosis.
    
Supported by: Kim Leadbeater (Labour, Spen Valley)

Richard Burgon (Independent, Leeds East):
    Richard Burgon voices concerns about societal coercion, saying the high costs of care might pressure terminally ill people to end their lives to not be financial burdens.

Opposed by: Kim Leadbeater (Labour, Spen Valley)

Wera Hobhouse (Liberal Democrat, Bath):

Supported by: Kim Leadbeater (Labour, Spen Valley)

Jim Shannon (Democratic Unionist Party, Strangford):
    Jim Shannon raises concerns about the Bill’s criteria, pointing to the Belgian experience where the scope of the law greatly expanded, leading to more permissive standards including assisted death for minors and dementia sufferers.

    Context: Pointing to international expansions of similar laws.
Opposed by: Kim Leadbeater (Labour, Spen Valley)

Opposed by: Kim Leadbeater (Labour, Spen Valley)

    Context: Arguing against the Bill on grounds of risk and the amendment process.

Alistair Strathern (Labour, Hitchin):
    Alistair Strathern questions Danny Kruger's certainty given ongoing suffering under current laws, indicating the difficulty in balancing harms. Danny Kruger acknowledges doubts but argues the Bill is too flawed for Committee amendment.
    Context: Addressing the balance of ongoing suffering versus potential harms.
Opposed by: Danny Kruger (Conservative, East Wiltshire)

Andrew George (Liberal Democrat, St Ives):
    Andrew George argues that today’s vote simply determines the motion's advancement to the next stage, where potential doubts can be addressed. Danny Kruger insists this stage isn't sufficient for necessary comprehensive changes.
    Context: On procedural implications of the vote.
Opposed by: Danny Kruger (Conservative, East Wiltshire)

Kevin McKenna (Labour, Sittingbourne and Sheppey):

Opposed by: Danny Kruger (Conservative, East Wiltshire)

Opposed by: Danny Kruger (Conservative, East Wiltshire)

Tim Farron (Liberal Democrat, Westmorland and Lonsdale):
    Tim Farron argues against the Bill due to coercion risks. He posits that legalizing assisted dying could create an environment where societal pressures lead vulnerable people to feel compelled to choose death, based on observed increases in assisted deaths elsewhere.
    Context: Concern about societal pressure and examples from other countries.

Diane Abbott (Labour, Hackney North and Stoke Newington):
    Dame Diane Abbott argues against the Bill, doubting the effectiveness of judicial safeguards in preventing coercion and referencing expanded criteria in other countries like Canada. She emphasises that societal pressures might drive vulnerable individuals toward assisted dying, reflecting general concerns about coercion and suggesting a commission to properly address this issue.
    Context: Discussing the ability to safeguard the vulnerable in light of foreign experiences.

Andrew Mitchell (Conservative, Sutton Coldfield):
    Andrew Mitchell reflects on changing his mind due to deeply moving constituents' storeys about painful and undignified deaths, emphasising that the decision today concerns a principle of extending choice and maintains this Bill has significant public support. He points out that the current system lacks transparency, regulation, and safeguards which this Bill aims to address, with Oregon as a cited example where similar laws have been stable.
    Context: Cites his changed opinion and the injustice of the current system.

Andy Slaughter (Labour, Hammersmith and Chiswick):
    Andy Slaughter highlights the insufficiency of current legal processes, which lack preventative coercion safeguards before the event of assisted dying occurs, advocating for the Bill's potential to provide those safeguards within new legal frameworks. He acknowledges this as an opportunity to improve the situation whilst still refining legal details in the future stages of the Bill’s development.
    Context: emphasises gaps in the current legal system that the Bill seeks to address.

Carla Lockhart (Democratic Unionist Party, Upper Bann):
    Carla Lockhart voices opposition to the Bill from her DUP perspective, emphasising the sanctity of life and inherent value of each individual. She argues that current societal biases and NHS underfunding inherently risk coercion and potential abuse of the vulnerable, warning against state-sanctioned assisted dying as it could represent a slippery slope.
    Context: Raises concerns about moral implications and societal pressure.

Alex Davies-Jones (Labour, Pontypridd):
    Alex Davies-Jones, responding neutrally as the Justice Minister, highlights that the Government views this issue as one of personal conscience rather than policy, and therefore offers MPs a free vote. She emphasises that any legislative change would be Parliament's decision as weighty moral considerations are at play.
    Context: Clarifying the Government's neutral stance and the importance of parliamentary decision-making.
