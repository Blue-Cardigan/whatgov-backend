Key Points:
Jim McMahon (Labour (Co-op), Oldham West, Chadderton and Royton):
    Jim McMahon mentioned that in July, the Deputy Prime Minister invited regions without devolution agreements, such as Somerset, to submit their proposals. This is part of an effort to explore different approaches to devolution across the country. The government welcomes Somersetâ€™s contribution and is eager to hear their perspective on the upcoming White Paper on English devolution.

Ashley Fox (Conservative, Bridgwater):
    Sir Ashley Fox expressed concerns that the Liberal Democrats' management has shifted Somerset from a two-tier council that balanced its books to a unitary council facing bankruptcy. He sought assurances from the Minister that no council reforms would be imposed on areas against their will, and that local public opinion would be prioritised in decision-making.

    Jim McMahon responded humorously to Sir Ashley Fox's comments about the Liberal Democrats, acknowledging the challenges associated with their governance. He assured that discussions with councils focus on devolution and reorganisation, aiming for more effective local governance. He emphasised that reorganisation should occur only when councils find it beneficial.

Vikki Slade (Liberal Democrat, Mid Dorset and North Poole):
    Vikki Slade raised concerns about potential top-down reorganisation through devolution agreements involving Dorset, Somerset, and Wiltshire. She noted constituents' fears that a mayoral combined authority might cause decisions to become more centralised, and worries over parish councils being used to financially support unitary councils, possibly leading to indirect tax hikes. She asked for assurances that local councils would not face such burdens.

Jim McMahon (Labour (Co-op), Oldham West, Chadderton and Royton):
    Jim McMahon assured Vikki Slade that central government aims to develop partnerships with local governments, expecting local councils to do the same with town and parish councils. He noted that whether reorganisation occurs or not, cooperation should continue without imposing financial burdens on parish councils to support unitary councils, thus avoiding backdoor tax increases.
    Context: Response to Vikki Slade's concerns about financial pressures on local councils and potential tax impacts due to devolution.
