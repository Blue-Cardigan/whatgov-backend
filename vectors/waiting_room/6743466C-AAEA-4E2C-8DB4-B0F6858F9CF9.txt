Prominent cases, such as the tragic deaths of Emily Chesterton and Susan Pollitt, were cited, prompting discussions on immediate safety measures, the need for official regulation, and a review led by Professor Gillian Leng to report by spring 2025.

Key Points:
Baroness Bennett of Manor Castle (Green Party, Life peer):
    Baroness Bennett raised concerns about the controversial implementation of physician associate (PA) and anaesthetist associate (AA) roles, citing increased debates and safety risks highlighted by various professionals and organisation.. She questions the level of cooperation the review led by Professor Gillian Leng will receive, and whether it will address issues such as impact on doctor training and the 'taskification' of medicine. Bennett also emphasises the need for interim measures to address the current situation where PAs are replacing doctors and calls for a halt in the recruitment of PAs in sensitive areas like paediatrics. She questions whether the current regulation process provides adequate monitoring and control.

Lord Scriven (Liberal Democrat, Life peer):
