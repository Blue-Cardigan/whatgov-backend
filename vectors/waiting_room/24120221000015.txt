Hilary Benn (Labour, Leeds South):
    In a broader context, the Government aims to reset relations with the EU to negotiate new agreements that eliminate unnecessary barriers to trade. The Windsor framework, particularly articles 5 to 10, is seen as a credible foundation for these negotiations while respecting Northern Irelandâ€™s position in the UK internal market. The Government plans to respond to the vote result, fulfill legal obligations, engage with stakeholders, and update the House.
