Summary:
The UK government confirmed the appointment of its delegation to the Council of Europe, prioritising collaboration across party lines while emphasising the UK's commitment to rule of law and democracy.
While cross-party cooperation was highlighted for the Council of Europe, delays in establishing a UK delegation to the EU-UK Parliamentary Assembly drew concern and speculation, signalling potential communication issues within Westminster politics.
Ministerial assurances were extended regarding continued governmental support for the UK's European diplomatic engagements, although the balance of judicial appointments was flagged as requiring careful non-partisan handling.
