Key Points:
Tulip Siddiq (Labour, Hampstead and Highgate):
    The draft Scottish Rates of Income Tax (Consequential Amendments) Order 2024 introduces amendments to account for the newly introduced Scottish advanced rate of income tax, beginning 6 April 2024. This rate splits the former Scottish higher rate, impacting the calculation of deficiency relief for certain life insurance policies. This order ensures fair application of tax relief under the new rates and simplifies the legislative language.

James Wild (Conservative, North West Norfolk):
    The Scottish Parliament's changes have increased the complexity of their tax system, now having six rates compared to three in the UK. While not opposing the order, the speaker questions its impact on Exchequer revenues and suggests such legislative changes should be more prompt in relation to tax year changes.

Tulip Siddiq (Labour, Hampstead and Highgate):
    The affected Scottish taxpayers are those claiming deficiency relief while paying at the Scottish advanced rate. Fewer than 10 taxpayers are expected to be impacted, with less than Â£5 million annual impact on Exchequer. Guidance is available at HMRC's 'Insurance Policyholder Taxation Manual', with updates to reflect changes.
    Context: Responding to James Wild's queries about the number of impacted taxpayers and the Exchequer impact.
