Key Points:
Kevin Bonavia (Labour, Stevenage):
    Kevin Bonavia introduced the debate, highlighting the importance of the two petitions on childhood bereavement during National Grief Awareness week. The first petition calls for recording the number of bereaved children to ensure they are supported, citing the lack of current data as a barrier to effective support. The second petition suggests incorporating content on death, dying, and bereavement into the national curriculum, emphasising the need to prepare children for real-life experiences and the gaps in emotional education. He thanked Winston’s Wish and Mark Lemon for their advocacy and highlighted a personal storey that underscores the necessity for the proposed changes.
