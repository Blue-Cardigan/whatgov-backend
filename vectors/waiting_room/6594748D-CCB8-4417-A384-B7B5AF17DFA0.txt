Tone: collaborative

Summary:
The House of Lords debated the pervasive issue of train crew shortages affecting service reliability across multiple rail operators, with Labour emphasising ongoing efforts to understand the root causes and implement reforms.
Baroness Randerson of the Liberal Democrats advocated for harmonization of employee terms and conditions through public ownership as a remedy, while Lord Hendy committed to collaborating with staff and unions to address outdated work practises.
Concerns were raised about inadequate management response times to crew shortages and the impact on passengers, prompting calls for hands-on managerial intervention to ensure sufficient staffing levels.

Key Points:
Baroness Randerson (Liberal Democrat, Life peer):
    Baroness Randerson asked the government to assess the reasons behind train crew shortages leading to service cancellations. She highlighted that both Northern Trains, a government-run entity, and Great Western Railway, a private sector operator, have cited crew shortages as a reason. She questioned the timing of any steps to harmonise employment terms across train services to improve service standards, particularly on weekends.

Lord Hendy of Richmond Hill (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Hendy acknowledged the dreadful state of train cancellations due to lack of train crew availability. He mentioned the inherited railway system's issues and the lack of useful knowledge from the previous government regarding staff levels and recruitment. The government has commissioned work on understanding crew numbers and is committed to rail reform to improve resource utilisation and reduce cancellations.

Baroness Randerson (Liberal Democrat, Life peer):
    Baroness Randerson expressed appreciation for the government's response but noted that nationalisation does not inherently solve crew shortage problems. She pressed for a coherent approach to employee terms that could modernise rail industry standards. The focus was on creating modern service standards and improving cancellations, especially on weekends.
