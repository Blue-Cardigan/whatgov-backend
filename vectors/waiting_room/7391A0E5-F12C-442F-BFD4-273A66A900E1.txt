Tone: contentious

Summary:
The House of Lords debated the need for legal recognition of humanist marriages following a High Court decision and the Law Commission's recommendations on wedding laws.
While members criticised delays in implementing reforms and highlighted the popularity of humanist marriages in Scotland, the Government committed only to a review 'in the round' of existing anomalies.
The debate reveals cross-party frustration with the lack of progress and highlights the potential equalities impact of formalising humanist marriage ceremonies in England and Wales.
