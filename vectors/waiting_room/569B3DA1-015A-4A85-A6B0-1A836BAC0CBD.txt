    Judith Cummins criticised Ministers for announcing major new policies to the media before presenting them in the House. This specific afternoon's statement was extensively covered by both print and broadcast media, as well as a detailed piece on the Home Office's website. Cummins noted that members from the current government previously criticised former Ministers for similar actions. She emphasised that Mr Speaker has pledged to maintain the same high standards for the current government. The Home Office was highlighted as frequently having issues with this practise.
