Summary:
The UK government has committed £27 million to support a programme in Bangladesh aimed at fostering political stability and protecting religious minorities amid rising violence against the Hindu community.
Cross-party calls were made for the UK to improve diplomatic efforts with Bangladesh to ensure security for minorities and an enquiry into recent violent incidents, as numerical verification of such indices remains contentious.
The debate, attended by members from all major parties, highlighted the complexity of navigating Bangladesh’s political crisis, emphasising the need for continued international engagement and potential UN involvement.
