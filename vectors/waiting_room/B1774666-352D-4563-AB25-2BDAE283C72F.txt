Keywords: UK-US military base, Diego Garcia, regional security, international allies

Baroness Goldie (Conservative, Life peer):
    Concerns were raised about signing the agreement under a US President with diminished authority rather than waiting for the President-elect. Additionally, given increased global risks, questions arose about the potential loss of control over regional security, and the possibility of malign activities in the area.
    Context: Questions raised regarding the timing and security implications of the Diego Garcia agreement.
Keywords: US Presidency, global risks, malign activities, security control

Baroness Chapman of Darlington (Labour, Life peer):
    The agreement provides legal security for the UK-US base after 50 years of challenge. Discussion highlighted the prioritisation of security over other issues, including the grievance of the Chagossian community. It was emphasised that the agreement underwent numerous negotiation rounds and is not perceived as rushed.
    Context: Response to concerns about the speed and focus of the agreement negotiation.
Opposed by: Baroness Goldie (Conservative, Life peer)
Keywords: legal security, Chagossian grievance, negotiation rounds, UK-US base

Lord Purvis of Tweed (Liberal Democrat, Life peer):
    Support was given for the principle of allowing the new Mauritian Government to review the agreement and involve the Chagossian community in the parliamentary scrutiny process. However, there were concerns about the deficiencies in the CRaG process.
    Context: Discussion on the involvement of the Mauritian Government and Chagossians in the agreement process.
Supported by: Baroness Chapman of Darlington (Labour, Life peer)
Keywords: Mauritian Government review, Chagossian involvement, CRaG process

Baroness Chapman of Darlington (Labour, Life peer):
    There is no set timetable for the new Mauritian Prime Minister to review the agreement. During this transition period, the UK respects the US's rules for engaging with other Governments. Jonathan Powell's input from his US visit was also mentioned.
    Context: Clarification on timelines and engagement procedures under the agreement.
Opposed by: Lord Anderson of Swansea (Labour, Life peer)
Keywords: no timetable, Mauritian PM review, US engagement rules, Jonathan Powell

Lord Lancaster of Kimbolton (Conservative, Life peer):
    Concerns were expressed about no UK Minister planning to visit Diego Garcia soon. Comparisons were made to sovereign bases like Cyprus, suggesting the government should consider a similar model of ceding sovereignty while maintaining strategic control.
    Context: Critique on the government's approach to sovereignty and strategic base management.
Opposed by: Baroness Chapman of Darlington (Labour, Life peer)
Keywords: Ministerial visits, sovereign base model, Cyprus comparison, strategic control

Lord Grocott (Labour, Life peer):
    It was emphasised that self-determination is a critical principle in British decolonization, with engagement of the Chagossians being important. However, the historical context and legal status of the Chagos Islands are unique. The community should not be used for political gain.
    Context: Discussion on the role of self-determination regarding the Chagossian community.
Supported by: Baroness Chapman of Darlington (Labour, Life peer)
Keywords: self-determination, British decolonization, Chagossian engagement, political gain

Lord Howell of Guildford (Conservative, Life peer):
    There is awareness of Chinese interest in the region, particularly concerning Mauritius. Mauritius is not involved in the Belt and Road Initiative and is aligned closely with India. Concerns about security threats from Chinese influence were addressed during negotiations.
    Context: Discussion on external influences, particularly China's interest in Mauritius and regional security.
Keywords: Chinese interest, Mauritius-China relations, Belt and Road Initiative, regional security
