Summary:
In a recent parliamentary debate, MPs from various constituencies discussed the critical minerals sector's potential in boosting the UK’s energy transition and economic security, emphasising the necessity of establishing a domestic supply chain.
Labour MPs highlighted the importance of local extraction and production, particularly in Cornwall and other UK regions, and underscored the sector’s breadth of job creation and socioeconomic benefits.
The discussion saw broad support for developing a comprehensive critical minerals strategy, with calls for government incentives and support mechanisms to avoid reliance on foreign imports, particularly from China-dominated supply chains.
