Summary:
Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay introduced amendments concerning the membership and accountability of the new independent football regulator, focusing on conflict-of-interest protections and parliamentary oversight to ensure fair governance. 
Debate highlighted concerns around overreach and the potential impact of the Bill on ownership structures, with significant focus on how best to balance regulatory powers with ensuring investment and club growth aren’t hindered.
While there was some consensus on the need for parliamentary scrutiny of the regulator’s actions, contrasting views emerged about the ramifications of state intervention, particularly in relation to UEFA and FIFA’s stance on interference.

Key Points:
Lord Kennedy of Southwark (Labour, Life peer):
    Lord Kennedy of Southwark from the Labour Party emphasised that substantial progress needs to be made on the Football Governance Bill as the committee is on its third day. He urged stakeholders to expedite discussions to avoid delays.
    
Keywords: Football Governance Bill, committee progress, Labour Party, timeline importance, expedite discussions

Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay (Conservative, Life peer):
    Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay from the Conservative Party moved Amendment 19, which aims to specify competitions such as the Premier League and English Football League in the Bill. He argued that codifying these leagues would provide certainty to football clubs and competition organizers regarding their regulatory scope. Additionally, he raised concerns about the hybridity issue, suggesting the Bill might inadvertently become hybrid if specific leagues are named, and questioned if it should be referred to the Examiners.
