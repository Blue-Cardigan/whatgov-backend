Tone: contentious

Summary:
The draft regulations discussed aim to apply sanitary and phytosanitary controls on goods entering Great Britain through Northern Ireland, targeting non-qualifying goods, while maintaining the ongoing commitment to unfettered access for Northern Ireland goods.
Despite the government's assurances, strong concerns were raised by opposition members and DUP representatives regarding potential disruptions to trade and the lack of a comprehensive impact assessment and communication strategy with Northern Ireland businesses.
Minister Emma Hardy confirmed the temporary nature of the regulations, promising extensive consultations and updates by summer 2025 to address the evolving trade framework and bolster biosecurity compliance, seeking to reassure concerned parties about both procedural clarity and alignment with broader governmental commitments.

Key Points:
Emma Hardy (Labour, Kingston upon Hull West and Haltemprice):
    Emma Hardy introduced the draft regulations aimed at ensuring sanitary and phytosanitary controls for EU and rest-of-world goods entering Great Britain through Northern Ireland, emphasising the need to maintain UK biosecurity and support unfettered access arrangements for qualifying Northern Ireland goods. The regulations will apply pre-notification and certification requirements to non-qualifying goods and make amendments to align with recent changes in the definition of qualifying Northern Ireland goods.
    

Tom Collins (Labour, Worcester):
    Tom Collins highlighted that the long-term approach to movements between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is still under development. He questioned whether an impact assessment would be conducted if the transitional period extends beyond its current deadline.
    

Emma Hardy (Labour, Kingston upon Hull West and Haltemprice):
    Emma Hardy responded to Tom Collins, confirming the ongoing development work and reiterated the temporary nature of the controls for goods entering Great Britain from Ireland ahead of the expiry of the transitional staging period in July 2025. The amendments cover England, Wales, and Scotland, ensuring Northern Ireland businesses maintain unfettered access.
    Context: Response to Tom Collins

Neil Hudson (Conservative, Epping Forest):
    Dr Neil Hudson expressed concerns about the regulations potentially impacting goods movement from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, stressing the need for impact assessments to secure unfettered trade and support businesses affected by the new regulations. He explained that the opposition would abstain from the vote.
    

Sammy Wilson (Democratic Unionist Party, East Antrim):
    Sammy Wilson criticised the division of Northern Ireland from the UK as the reason for the regulations, arguing that trade disruption and Northern Ireland's exposure to risks remain due to cheques not taking place between Ireland and Northern Ireland. He questioned the practicality of current arrangements and suggested cheques should be possible without hard borders; thus, questioning why principles applied here aren't used for trade with the Republic of Ireland. He concerns about biosecurity and potential trade disruption affecting Northern Ireland's key market.
    

Carla Lockhart (Democratic Unionist Party, Upper Bann):
    Carla Lockhart raised concerns about the complexity and barriers imposed by moving SPS controls to the Irish Sea, potentially disrupting Northern Ireland's agrifood businesses. She highlighted the need for clarity and consultation with businesses to mitigate confusion and economic harm.
    

Jim Allister (Traditional Unionist Voice, North Antrim):
    Jim Allister argued that the SPS cheques principle used for goods moving from the Republic of Ireland to Great Britain should be reciprocal for other transitions, questioning the exclusivity of the Irish Sea border protocol and calling for sovereignty recovery over Northern Ireland.
    

Robin Swann (Ulster Unionist Party, South Antrim):
    Robin Swann asked about the competitive advantage claims related to the draft regulations and sought clarity on dissemination and support mechanisms for businesses to comply without penalties. He questioned the financial implications of permanent cheque posts outlined in the regulations.
    

Emma Hardy (Labour, Kingston upon Hull West and Haltemprice):
    Emma Hardy addressed concerns raised by various members, emphasising unfettered access for qualifying goods and temporary nature of the regulations. She promised ongoing communication and support for businesses and to provide detailed responses to any further queries after the debate.
