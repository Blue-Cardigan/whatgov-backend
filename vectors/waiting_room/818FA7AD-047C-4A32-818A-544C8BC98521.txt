Summary:
In a bid to enhance public service delivery, Preet Kaur Gill introduced a Bill calling for the mandatory inclusion of 'Sikh' and 'Jewish' categories in ethnicity data collection by public bodies, spotlighting the historical oversight in demographic recording against existing legal recognition.
The Bill, which has secured bipartisan backing, aims to address critical disparities in areas like health and crime where Sikhs and Jews are disproportionately affected, as evidenced by pandemic outcome disparities and issues such as organ donor registration.
With cross-party support, the adoption of this Bill could lead to significant policy shifts in public data collection, thus enabling more equitable service provision and potentially reshaping legislative approaches to minority representation and anti-discrimination efforts.

Key Points:
Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    Preet Kaur Gill proposed a Bill requiring public bodies to include 'Sikh' and 'Jewish' categories when collecting ethnicity data for public services, addressing the lack of specific data collection for these groups despite their legal recognition as ethnic groups under the Equality Act 2010.
    

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    Gill emphasised that current data on Sikhs and Jews is primarily religious rather than ethnic, resulting in poor quality and incomplete data usage, which excludes non-practising individuals and does not inform public service decisions.
    

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    She highlighted that the absence of dedicated ethnic data makes Sikhs and Jews invisible to policymakers, neglecting the discrimination and inequalities they encounter.
    

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
     Gill argued that existing practises incorrectly assume religious data suffices, which fails to address inequalities because it is not used for service delivery.
    Context: Gill counters the assumption that current religious data is a suitable substitute for ethnic data.

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    The Bill seeks to facilitate systematic data collection on Sikhs and Jews, noting its significance given the upcoming ethnicity pay gap reporting commitment from the government.
    

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    Gill cited community support for the Bill from the Sikh Council, UK gurdwaras, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Antisemitism Policy Trust, and others.
    

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    She provided examples such as higher covid mortality rates among Sikhs and Jews not reflected in existing ethnic categories, arguing this demands better data collection to address health inequalities.
    

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    Gill indicated NHS Blood and Transplant's failure to collect data on Sikh organ donors as an avoidable systemic oversight needing rectification for increased donor sign-ups.
    Context: Gill describes a specific systemic failure to collect essential ethnic data on Sikh donors which affects service outcomes.

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    David Baddiel's critique of the lack of an ethnic tick box for Jews was noted, highlighting the alienation and misrepresentation in current practise.
    

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    Gill pointed out that antisemitic and anti-Sikh hate crimes might be undercounted due to insufficiently detailed data collection criteria.
    

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    Arts bodies are criticised for not acknowledging Jewish identity beyond religion, leading to cultural erasure, as noted by Jewish cultural figures.
    

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    She expressed concern over growing numbers of non-practising ethnic Jews and Sikhs being omitted in data due to reliance on religious categories.
    

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    Gill stressed that including Jews and Sikhs as ethnic categories aligns with their legal status and aids in tackling ethnic-specific discrimination and inequalities.
    

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    She reported that despite recognition of Sikh ethnic data needs, its absence impedes service design and delivery, with evident disparities in housing, health, and other areas.
    

Preet Kaur Gill (Labour (Co-op), Birmingham Edgbaston):
    Gill concluded by urging legislative support for the Bill to correct the historically rooted misclassification and ensure fair representation in public data.
