Summary:
Proportional representation was advocated by the Liberal Democrats through a ten-minute rule Bill, citing recent evidence of disproportionate election results and voter disengagement as fundamental threats to democracy.
In opposition, Conservative MP Lewis Cocking defended the existing first-past-the-post system, emphasising its simplicity, stability, and strong constituency link, and highlighted past public preference for maintaining this method.
The passage of the Bill to the Second Reading signifies increased political momentum for electoral reform, although it faces significant resistance from established party positions, notably among Conservatives who emphasise historical voting patterns.

Key Points:
Sarah Olney (Liberal Democrat, Richmond Park):
    Sarah Olney proposed a Bill to introduce proportional representation for parliamentary and local government elections in England. She highlighted the disproportionate results of the recent general elections, where the Labour party obtained two-thirds of the seats with only a third of the votes, leaving many voters unrepresented. Olney argued that the first-past-the-post system causes significant voter disengagement, with turnout in 2024 being the second lowest since 1918. She emphasised that a fair voting system is crucial for democracy and that proportional representation is already effectively used in UK devolved elections.
    

Sarah Olney (Liberal Democrat, Richmond Park):
    Sarah Olney apologised for allowing a Member to attempt an intervention during her ten-minute rule speech and resumed her proposal. She advocated for the single transferable vote (STV) system that maintains a direct link between MPs and their constituencies while ensuring MPs have majority support from their constituents. She pointed out that many MPs won with less than 50% of the vote, and some with less than 30%. Olney stated that proportional representation would make UK elections more aligned with those in Scotland and Wales, where STV is already in use.
    Context: Continuing her speech on the proposal of proportional representation after being reminded of procedural rules by Judith Cummins.

Sarah Olney (Liberal Democrat, Richmond Park):
    Sarah Olney criticised the prior Conservative Government for its actions that eroded trust in democracy, such as cronyism and weakening the Electoral Commission's independence. Olney argued for scrapping the voter ID scheme and emphasised that the best way to rebuild public trust is through electoral reform towards proportional representation. She noted widespread support for electoral reform both within Parliament, including from Labour members, and among the public. Olney mentioned the launch of the all-party parliamentary group for fair elections and its report on the decline of trust in politics.
    Context: Description of broader issues causing democratic disenchantment and advocating for broader electoral reform measures.

Sarah Olney (Liberal Democrat, Richmond Park):
    Sarah Olney concluded her speech by stating that the first-past-the-post system is fundamentally unfair and has led to a Labour landslide with only 34% of the vote. She argued for modernising the electoral system to ensure every vote counts and to rebuild trust and engagement with politics. Olney emphasised that proportional representation would encourage political collaboration and accountability.
    Context: Final remarks summarising the need for electoral reform and the perceived faults of the current system.

Lewis Cocking (Conservative, Broxbourne):
    Lewis Cocking supported retaining the first-past-the-post system, valuing its simplicity where the candidate with most votes wins the seat. He argued that proportional representation complicates the system and could weaken the connexion between constituents and their MPs, as multiple MPs from different parties would represent a single constituency. He suggested this would polarise communities and confuse voters about who to contact regarding issues.
    Context: In response and opposition to the motion introduced by Sarah Olney.
Opposed by: Sarah Olney (Liberal Democrat, Richmond Park)

Lewis Cocking (Conservative, Broxbourne):
    Lewis Cocking emphasised that first-past-the-post provides stability and clarity post-election, with clear winners and the ability to change the Government if desired by voters. He argued that proportional representation leads to undemocratic post-election political bargaining, highlighting the situation in Ireland as an example. Cocking recalled the 2011 referendum where the majority voted to keep first-past-the-post, maintaining it's wrong to change the system against public opposition.
    Context: Further justifying why the existing electoral system should remain in place, referencing past public votes.
