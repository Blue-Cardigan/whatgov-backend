Summary:
The UK's House of Commons Public Bill Committee debated the Employment Rights Bill, focusing on clause 3 which concerns employer responsibilities for shift changes and cancellations, proposing short-notice payments and specifying the criteria for reasonable notice.
Despite cross-party queries about the lack of initial detail and the clarity required for businesses and employees, the Government committed to consult on regulations and set a 2026 implementation timeline, seeking to balance worker protection with business flexibility.
Amendments were made to refine payment terms, tribunal claims, and detriment regulations, though opposition voiced concerns about potential ambiguity and the need for robust consultation to ensure practical application.
