Summary:
The Labour government intends to overhaul public procurement with the implementation of the Procurement Act 2023, emphasising increased access for small businesses and efficiency in spending £300 billion annually. 
The appointment of a new covid corruption commissioner and action against late payments to SMEs highlight a commitment to transparency and accountability, promising procurement practises that diverge sharply from those criticised under the previous administration. 
Tensions arose over the impact of raised national insurance on procurement costs, but further details are deferred to February, leaving some economic implications unresolved.
