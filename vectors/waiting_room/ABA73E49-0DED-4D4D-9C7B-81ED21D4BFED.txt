Summary:
In a debate concerning the financial sustainability of UK higher education, MPs from various parties highlighted challenges such as declining university funding, increased tuition fees, and the impact of policy decisions on international student income.
While Labour MPs emphasised the urgent need for strategic funding reforms and reinstatement of maintenance grants, the Liberal Democrats called for a comprehensive review of the sector's financial arrangements before further fee increases, and Conservatives pointed out record research investments yet noted teaching-related financial strains.
The debate uncovered plans for a transformation taskforce aimed at sector efficiency and pressed the government for clarity on the financial impact of recent national insurance changes, with a consensus on the urgent need for collaborative action to sustain the higher education sector.

Key Points:
Adam Thompson (Labour, Erewash):
    Adam Thompson opened the debate by emphasising the critical importance of financial sustainability in higher education. He noted that universities are essential for economic growth and workforce skill development but face declining investment. Tuition fees in England have not kept pace with inflation, leading to a real-terms decline in their value. Government grants have also decreased significantly over a decade. He highlighted regional funding disparities and projected a sector-wide financial deficit.

Adam Thompson (Labour, Erewash):
    Adam Thompson responded, acknowledging the risk of socio-economic barriers to education due to rising fees.
