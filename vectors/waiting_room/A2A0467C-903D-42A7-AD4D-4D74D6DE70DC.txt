Summary:
The debate centred on the critical importance of biosecurity for sectors like agriculture and horticulture, highlighting specific disease threats such as bluetongue, avian influenza, and African swine fever.
Members from various parties voiced concerns over weak links, proposing stronger border controls and investments in research facilities, with some sparking discussions on insurance inadequacies and workforce shortages.
Minister Zeichner acknowledged the widespread concerns and reiterated government commitments, including a pledge to maintain biosecurity investments and address gaps in existing defences, though resource constraints were acknowledged.

Key Points:
Ben Goldsborough (Labour, South Norfolk):
    Ben Goldsborough discussed the impact of biosecurity on South Norfolk, citing the bluetongue outbreak that began in Haddiscoe and the avian influenza outbreak from 2022-2023. He called for strengthening border controls, reevaluating insurance practises for farmers, and improving the preparedness of the Animal and Plant Health Agency. He emphasised the need for support for farmers within restriction zones who face price deductions due to outbreaks. Additionally, he highlighted the importance of government investment in biosecurity, such as the Â£208 million allocated for the Weybridge site.
    

Jim Shannon (Democratic Unionist Party, Strangford):
    Jim Shannon pointed out that policies on biosecurity vary across regions and are devolved to different governmental bodies. He stressed the importance of coordinated discussions among the UK regions, especially when sharing examples of managing outbreaks like avian influenza and bovine TB, which are significant issues in Northern Ireland.
    Context: Following Ben Goldsborough's remarks on regional biosecurity issues.
Supported by: Gregory Campbell (Democratic Unionist Party, East Londonderry)

Luke Charters (Labour, York Outer):
    Mr. Luke Charters warned about threats from diseases like bluetongue and African swine fever and highlighted the importance of resources and systematic planning for biosecurity agencies such as Weybridge labs and Dover Port Health Authority. He called for ongoing government funding to support these agencies' operations more effectively.
    Context: In response to discussions on biosecurity threats and responses.

Terry Jermy (Labour, South West Norfolk):
    Terry Jermy raised concerns about the proposed mega-farm in Methwold, South West Norfolk, which could contribute to biodiversity loss. He shared worries over intensive farming's contribution to flu pandemics and high disease risks, emphasising that government preparation for such outbreaks can prevent long-term costs.
    Context: Discussion of biosecurity risks from large-scale farming operations.
Supported by: Ben Goldsborough (Labour, South Norfolk)

Sarah Dyke (Liberal Democrat, Glastonbury and Somerton):
    Sarah Dyke expressed concern over the increased likelihood of simultaneous outbreaks of multiple diseases like bluetongue and avian influenza. She emphasised the need for proper infrastructure and a skilled workforce to manage this. She also advocated for better vaccination production capacity to mitigate potential biosecurity threats.
    Context: In the context of managing multiple disease threats concurrently.

Neil Hudson (Conservative, Epping Forest):
    Dr. Neil Hudson recalled his experience on the frontline of the foot and mouth outbreak, highlighting the devastating impacts and the need for comprehensive biosecurity measures. He called for full funding of the APHA redevelopment, reiterating that biosecurity is fundamental to national security, and urged the government to support mental health services for those affected by biosecurity measures.
    Context: Relating personal experience with past disease outbreaks and their impacts.

Daniel Zeichner (Labour, Cambridge):
    Daniel Zeichner outlined the government's robust measures in maintaining biosecurity through expert risk groups, surveillance, and prevention efforts. He reassured continued DEFRA investment and capability to respond to threats like African swine fever while acknowledging the need for further cooperation and investment in resources like APHA Weybridge.
    Context: Government's stance on ongoing biosecurity challenges and resource allocations.
