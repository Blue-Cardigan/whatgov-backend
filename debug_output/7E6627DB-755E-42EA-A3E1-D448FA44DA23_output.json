What steps the Church is taking to improve the maintenance of the Hyde Park Estate. \n\nSpeaker [Name: Marsha De Cordova]:\nThe Hyde Park estate has been managed by the Church Commissioners for over 150 years, and they are committed to its long-term stewardship. As responsible landlords, the commissioners are committed to adopting best practice and have continuous investment programmes for the management of buildings on the estate to ensure that they remain fit for purpose both now and in the future.\n\nSpeaker [Name: Rachel Blake]:\nI have been working for months with residents of the Quadrangle, the Water Gardens and Connaught Village on the scale of their service charges. They have managed to reduce their service charges by 10%. Will my hon. Friend join me in congratulating them on their hard work and agree that they should not have had to work that hard? Will she join me in a meeting with the Church Commissioners to improve the transparency and monitoring of service charge levels?\n\nSpeaker [Name: Marsha De Cordova]:\nOf course I congratulate the residents on their hard work. I know from my constituency about the challenges around increases in service charges; it is so important that they are transparent to everybody. I would be happy to join my hon. Friend in a meeting with her residents on this issue, and I would recommend including those from the Church Commissioners’ property services team. I hope that will be okay.\n\nSpeaker [Name: Jim Shannon (Strangford) (DUP)]:\nThe Hyde Park estate is an oasis of peace and tranquillity in the middle of the concrete and buildings and used daily by many. What steps will the Church take to ensure that there are sufficient waste disposal and recycling bins across the Hyde Park estate, for those with two legs, and indeed for those with four legs?\n\nSpeaker [Name: Marsha De Cordova]:\nI am sure that those managing and maintaining the estate are looking at all those issues, but I would be happy to write to the hon.
